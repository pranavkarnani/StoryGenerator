Emotions, coitus, and the concept of family are a taboo.
Everyone is clad in identical uniforms and has shaven heads to emphasize equality, except the police androids (who wear black) and robed monks.
Instead of names, people have designations â reminiscent of licence plates â with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the ""prefix"") and four digits; shown on an identity badge worn at all times.
At their jobs in central video CCTV control centers, SEN 5241 and LUH 3417 keep surveillance on the city.
LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers.
At the beginning of the story, THX leaves the job while the loudspeakers urge the workers to ""increase safety"", and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period, to the competing factory's 242.
On the way home, he stops at a confession booth in a row of many, and mumbles prayers about ""party"" and ""masses"", under the portrait of ""OMM 0910"".
A soothing voice greets THX, and OMM ends every confession with a parting salutation: ""You are a true believer, blessings of the State, blessings of the masses.
Work hard, increase production, prevent accidents and be happy"".
At home, THX takes his drugs, and watches holo-broadcasts while engaging with a masturbatory device.
LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX's medications; whereupon THX eventually suffers physical discomfort (vomiting) along with mental/emotional changes (confusion).
The drug substitution also leads to LUH and THX becoming involved romantically, resulting in the two engaging in intercourse.
THX later is confronted by SEN, who arranges THX as his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal housing mate change.
Without drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a ""mind lock"" on THX which raises the level of danger.
After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase.

2,"<BOS> The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets.  Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop. <SEP> Prelude to Foundation opens on the planet Trantor, the empire's capital planet, the day after Hari Seldon has given a speech at a conference.
Several parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history).
Seldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile.
Over the course of the book, Seldon and Dors Venabili, a female companion, are taken from location to location by an aide, Chetter Hummin, who introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor.
Throughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science.
Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop.
Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory.
Eventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming, then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy.
Eight years after the events of Prelude, Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale.
His notability and fame increase and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor.
As the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age.
Having worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation.
Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling.
If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second Empire arises.
However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled Encyclopedia Galactica.
The board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the ""Encyclopedists"" be exiled to a remote planet, Terminus.
Seldon agrees to","[""<BOS> The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets.

F'lar recognizes that Lessa possesses both unusually strong psychic abilities and great strength of will.  However, when this narrative begins, an unusually long interval between Thread attacks has caused the general population to dismiss the threat as myth and gradually withdraw support from the Weyrs where dragons are bred and trained.  This not only provides much needed skilled reinforcements in the battle against Thread, but explains how and why the five Weyrs were abandoned: they came forward in time. <SEP> Dragonflight takes place in the far future on Pern, a planet colonized by humans.
The colonists had originally intended to gradually adopt a low-technology agrarian lifestyle, but were forced to move more quickly after they encountered the deadly Thread raining down from the sky.
By harnessing and riding the indigenous, flying, fire-breathing dragons (with genetic alterations to make them larger and telepathic), the colonists destroyed the Thread in the skies over Pern, creating pockets of safety over its surface, before it was able to burrow into the land and breed.
Humanity finally managed to find equilibrium and began to create a thriving culture, society, and economy, eventually expanding right across Pern's northern continent.
However, when this narrative begins, an unusually long interval between Thread attacks has caused the general population to dismiss the threat as myth and gradually withdraw support from the Weyrs where dragons are bred and trained.
By the time of this narrative, only one Weyr remains (the other five having mysteriously disappeared at the same time in the last quiet interval), maintaining a precarious existence.
Dragons are telepathic and are capable of forming a lifelong bond with one particular human in a process called Impression.
Tradition, established thousands of years before the narrative, dictates that selected young humans with empathetic and telepathic talents are taken to the Hatching Grounds as candidates for Impression.
The dragons come in several colors which generally correlate with their sizes; blue males, green females, brown males, bronze males, and golden females&nbsp;â queens.
Bronzes, the largest males, are by tradition the only ones who compete to win the queens in their mating flights.
The green females are banned from breeding as they produce only small, less talented dragons.
The golden queens are not only the largest dragons, they also hold a subtle control over their dragon communities Weyrs.
Dragonflight chronicles the story of Lessa, the sole survivor of the noble ruling family of Ruatha Hold on the northern continent of Pern.
When the rest of her family is killed by a cruel usurper, Fax, she survives by disguising herself as a drudge (a menial servant), partly through simply adopting a slovenly appearance, but also by using her hereditary telepathic abilities","['<BOS> Her only friend is a watch-wher, a somewhat telepathic animal related to dragons, that guards the Hold.

5,"<BOS> Forrest returns home when his mother falls terminally ill and stays with her until her death. <SEP> The plot is delivered in a number of lengthy flashbacks in the narrative of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) as he sits at a bus stop with a suitcase full of mementos in Savannah, Georgia in 1981.
He initiates conversation with a stranger and recalls his childhood in Greenbow, Alabama during the 1950s.
Forrest is raised by a single mother (Sally Field) who runs a bed and breakfast for travelling folk including at one point a young Elvis Presley, and has to wear leg braces to fix a crooked back.
Despite having a diminished intellect, Forrest is admitted to public school after his mother agrees to have sex with the principal.
On his first day of school, Forrest meets Jenny Curran, a girl his age who becomes his best friend and is a victim of child molestation by her father.
The children bond, finding in each other a confidante and kindred spirit.
With Jenny's encouragement, Forrest runs away from a group of bullies, struggling until his leg braces break off and he finds that he is able to run very fast.
Years later, while fleeing the same group of bullies, he runs onto a football field during a practice observed by legendary coach Paul ""Bear"" Bryant, which gets him into the University of Alabama on a football scholarship.
He features in the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door and listens to George Wallace.
He then meets President John Kennedy as a member of the NCAA ""All-American"" team.
After graduation, he enlists in the army, where he excels at drill exercises and befriends fellow recruit Benjamin Buford Blue, nicknamed ""Bubba"" (Mykelti Williamson), an aspiring shrimp boat captain who suggests they go into the shrimp business together after the war.
They are sent to Vietnam under Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).
After four months of patrolling in rain, Bubba is killed during their first encounter, an ambush which leaves many of their fellow soldiers wounded.
Lieutenant Dan sustains major injuries and loses both his legs.
Forrest is wounded in the buttocks while saving members of his platoonâincluding Lieutenant Danâand is awarded the Medal of Honor, presented to him by President Lyndon Johnson at the White House.
At an anti-war rally in Washington featuring Abbie Hoffman, Forrest reunites with Jenny, who has joined the hippie movement after being expelled from college over topless photos of herself and experimenting with drugs.

7,"<BOS> General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions.  This episode is notable for having one of the show's few truly serious dramatic moments, with each team member privately reminiscing on their war experiences, intercut with news footage from the war with Barry McGuire's Eve of Destruction playing in the background. <SEP> The A-Team is a naturally episodic show, with few overarching stories, except the characters' continuing motivation to clear their names, with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure.
In describing the ratings drop that occurred during the show's fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity ""because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome"".
Similarly, reporter Adrian Lee called the plots ""stunningly simple"" in a 2006 article for The Express (UK newspaper), citing such recurring elements ""as BA's fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items"".
The show became emblematic of this kind of ""fit-for-TV warfare"" due to its depiction of high-octane combat scenes, with lethal weapons, wherein the participants (with the notable exception of General Fulbright) are never killed and rarely seriously injured (see also On-screen violence section).
As the television ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986â87 in a bid to win back viewers.
After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military.
General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions.
In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity.
With the help of a new character, Frankie ""Dishpan Man"" Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad.
The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast.
The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of, and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands.
These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline.
Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season.

Then, he embarks on a 20-year trip around the world with his loyal servant Smautf (also a resident of 11 rue Simon-Crubellier), painting a watercolor of a different port roughly every two weeks for a total of 500 watercolors.
Bartlebooth then sends each painting back to France, where the paper is glued to a support board, and a carefully selected craftsman named Gaspard Winckler (also a resident of 11 rue Simon-Crubellier) cuts it into a jigsaw puzzle.
Upon his return, Bartlebooth spends his time solving each jigsaw, re-creating the scene.
Each finished puzzle is treated to re-bind the paper with a special solution invented by Georges Morellet, another resident of 11 rue Simon-Crubellier.
After the solution is applied, the wooden support is removed, and the painting is sent to the port where it was painted.
Exactly 20 years to the day after it was painted, the painting is placed in a detergent solution until the colors dissolve, and the paper, blank except for the faint marks where it was cut and re-joined, is returned to Bartlebooth.
Ultimately, there would be nothing to show for 50 years of work: the project would leave absolutely no mark on the world.
Unfortunately for Bartlebooth, Winckler's puzzles become increasingly difficult and Bartlebooth himself becomes blind.
An art fanatic also intervenes in an attempt to stop Bartlebooth from destroying his art.

Dirk learns that the missing cat was never missing in the first place as a result of their actions, and <SEP> In the book the plot emerges in a fragmented way, with shifting points of view and events that seem out of order.
As presented, it shows Richard MacDuff avoiding his boss Gordon Way, the CEO of Wayforward Technologies II, by going to the Coleridge dinner at his old college St Cedd's.
Following the annual reading of ""Kubla Khan"" and ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" by Coleridge, MacDuff witnesses his former tutor, Professor Urban ""Reg"" Chronotis, perform an inexplicable magic trick where he makes a cruet disappear and then finds it again by smashing an ancient clay pot that a young girl brought to the dinner, having found it on holiday in Greece.
When MacDuff and Prof.
Chronotis' adjourn to the professor's lodgings, they find a horse there, which the Professor is alarmed about but unable to explain.
MacDuff returns to his London flat and finds himself doing things that are out of character, including climbing a drainpipe to break into the flat belonging to Gordon's sister Susan to erase an embarrassing message he left on her answering machine and later named a suspect in the death of Gordon Way.
At that point Dirk Gently, a self-claimed ""Holistic Detective"" that believes in the ""fundamental interconnectedness of all things"" and currently searching for a missing cat, intervenes and sets about solving the mystery, even though MacDuff was not aware that there was one.
Four billion years in Earth's past, a group of Salaxalans attempts to populate the Earth; however, a mistake caused by their engineer â who used an Electric Monk to irrationally believe the proposed fix would work â causes their landing craft to explode, killing the Salaxalans and generating the spark of energy needed to start the process of life on Earth.
The ghost of the Salaxalan engineer roams the earth waiting to undo his mistake, watching human life develop and waiting to find a soul that it can possess.
The ghost finds it can only possess individuals that fundamentally want to do the same task it is trying to accomplish itself.
Otherwise, it is only able to influence the individual in subtle ways.

After Sergei gives Lou a diamond pin belonging to Rita, Rita starts a fight with Lou, who accidentally stabs her to death.  He also sends young women to San Francisco to be pickpockets. <SEP> The story is set in New York City in the 1890s.
A bawdy singer, Lady Lou (Mae West), works in the Bowery barroom saloon of her boss and benefactor, Gus Jordan (Noah Beery), who has given her many diamonds.
But Lou is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine.
What she does not know is that Gus trafficks in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds.
He also sends young women to San Francisco to be pickpockets.
Gus works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, Russian Rita (Rafaela Ottiano) and Rita's lover, the suave Sergei Stanieff (Gilbert Roland).
One of Gus's rivals and former ""friend"" of Lou's, named Dan Flynn (David Landau), spends most of the movie dropping hints to Lou that Gus is up to no good, promising to look after her once Gus is in jail.
Lou leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he'll see her jailed if she doesn't submit to him.
A city mission (a thinly disguised Salvation Army) is located next door to the bar.
Its young director, Captain Cummings (Cary Grant), is in reality an undercover Federal agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar.
Gus suspects nothing; he worries only that Cummings will reform his bar and scare away his customers.
Lou's former boyfriend, Chick Clark (Owen Moore), is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her.
In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer.
Warned that Chick thinks she's betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him.
All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly as she walks down the cellblock.
Chick becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out.
She lies and claims she has been true to him.
Gus gives counterfeit money to Rita and Sergei to spend.
Chick escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar.
He comes into Lou's room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her.
Lou calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number.

It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart.
The story is set in 1194, after the failure of the Third Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe.
King Richard, who had been captured by Leopold of Austria on his return journey to England, was believed to still be in captivity.
The legendary Robin Hood, initially under the name of Locksley, is also a character in the story, as are his ""merry men"".

The book was written and published during a period of increasing struggle for the emancipation of the Jews in England, and there are frequent references to injustices against them.
Protagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena, Cedric's ward and a descendant of the Saxon Kings of England, after Cedric planned to marry her to the powerful Lord Athelstane, a pretender to the Crown of England through his descent from the last Saxon King, Harold Godwinson.

By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS. <SEP> On 20 July 1944, a group of German army officers led by Claus von Stauffenberg and including some of the highest-ranked members of the German armed forces attempted to assassinate Hitler, but failed to do so.
The next day, Himmler formed a special commission that arrested over 5,000 suspected and known opponents of the regime.
Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people.
Though Himmler was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot, it led to an increase in his powers and authority.
General Friedrich Fromm, commander-in-chief of the Reserve (or Replacement) Army (Ersatzheer) and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one of those implicated in the conspiracy.
Hitler removed Fromm from his post and named Himmler as his successor.
Since the Reserve Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS.
He appointed Hans JÃ¼ttner, director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy, and began to fill top Reserve Army posts with SS men.
By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.
By this time, Hitler had appointed Himmler as Minister of the Interior and Plenipotentiary General for Administration (GeneralbevollmÃ¤chtigter fÃ¼r die Verwaltung).
In August 1944 Hitler authorised him to restructure the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services.
As head of the Reserve Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war.

She fears a faint, demonic voice outside her window say ""Join Us"".

Unsure of what happened and what to do, she decides not to mention the incident to the others.
When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recorder belonging to the archeologist who owned it.
When Scotty plays it, the archeologist's voice recites a series of incantations, resurrecting a mysterious, demonic entity.
Cheryl becomes increasingly hysterical and locks herself in her room.
Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate.
Meanwhile, Ash gives Linda a silver necklace, which she absolutely loves.
Cheryl is then attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape.
Unable to convince the others of what happened, she asks Ash to take her into town for the night.
However, Ash soon discovers that the bridge has been destroyed.
Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning that the only way to kill the entity is to dismember it when it possesses a host.
Cheryl succumbs to the entity and attacks the others, stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil before Scotty is able to force her into the cellar.
Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty to chop up her body with an axe and bury the remains.

16,"<BOS> Jane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters, and most editions are at least 400 pages long.  Literary critic Jerome Beaty opines that the close first person perspective leaves the reader ""too uncritically accepting of her worldview"", and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting Jane, regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives are. <SEP> The novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character.
The novel's setting is somewhere in the north of England, during the reign of George III (1760â1820), and goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, st John Rivers, proposes to her; and her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester.
During these sections the novel provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo (see the Themes section below).
Literary critic Jerome Beaty opines that the close first person perspective leaves the reader ""too uncritically accepting of her worldview"", and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting Jane, regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives are.
Jane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters, and most editions are at least 400 pages long.
The original publication was in three volumes, comprising chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38; this was a common publishing format during the 19th century (see three-volume novel).
BrontÃ« dedicated the novel's second edition to William Makepeace Thackeray.
The novel begins with the titular character, Jane Eyre, aged 10, living with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish.
It is several years after her parents died of typhus.
mr Reed, Jane's uncle, was the only person in the Reed family who was kind to Jane.
Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, treats her as a burden, and discourages her children from associating with Jane.
mrs Reed and her three children are abusive to Jane, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
The nursemaid Bessie proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie sometimes harshly scolds Jane.
Excluded from the family activities, Jane is incredibly unhappy, with only a doll and books for comfort.
One day, after her cousin John knocks her down and she attempts to defend herself, Jane is locked in the red room where her uncle died; there","['<BOS> Jane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters, and most editions are at least 400 pages long.

(Erik Rolf) and Sally (Ruth Warrick).
When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart for a while, and he is to live in the country with his mother and grandmother (Lucile Watson) while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship in the city's newspaper.
Johnny, distraught because his father has never left him or his mother before, leaves that night under cover of darkness and sets off for Atlanta with only a bindle.
As Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he is attracted by the voice of Uncle Remus (James Baskett) telling tales ""in his old-timey way"" of a character named Br'er Rabbit.
Curious, Johnny hides behind a nearby tree to spy on the group of people sitting around the fire.
By this time, word has gotten out that Johnny is gone and some plantation residents, who are sent out to find him, ask if Uncle Remus has seen the boy.
Uncle Remus replies that he's with him.
Shortly afterwards, he catches up with Johnny, who sits crying on a nearby log.
He befriends the young boy and offers him some food for the journey, taking him back to his cabin.
As Uncle Remus cooks, he mentions Br'er Rabbit again and the boy, curious, asks him to tell him more.
After Uncle Remus tells a tale about Br'er Rabbit (Johnny Lee) and his attempt to run away from home only to change his mind after an encounter with Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear (James Baskett and Nick Stewart), Johnny takes the advice and changes his mind about leaving the plantation, letting Uncle Remus take him back to his mother.
Johnny makes friends with Toby (Glenn Leedy), a little black boy who lives on the plantation, and Ginny Favers (Luana Patten), a poor white girl.
However, Ginny's two older brothers Joe (Gene Holland) and Jake (George Nokes) are not friendly at all; they constantly bully Ginny and Johnny.

21,"<BOS> All of these are set against a history lesson of an alternate 20th century in which a variety of social and philosophical commentary is delivered.  Maureen ends her memoir and the Lazarus Long saga with the phrase ""And we all lived happily ever after"". <SEP> The book is a memoir of Maureen Johnson Smith Long, mother, lover, and eventual wife of Lazarus Long.
Maureen is ostensibly recording the events of the book while held in prison alongside Pixel, the eponymous character of The Cat Who Walks Through Walls.
Maureen, born on July 4, 1882, recounts her girlhood in backcountry Missouri, discovery that her family is a member of the long-lived Howard Families (whose backstory is revealed in Methuselah's Children), marriage to Brian Smith, another member of that group, and her lifeâlargely in Kansas Cityâuntil her apparent death in 1982.
In addition, Maureen lives through, and gives her (sometimes contradictory) viewpoints on many events in other Heinlein stories, most notably the 1917 visit from the future by ""Ted Bronson"" (Lazarus Long), told from Long's point of view in Time Enough for Love, Harriman's space program from The Man Who Sold the Moon, and the rolling roads from The Roads Must Roll.
The adventures of Maureen include a series of sexual encounters, beginning in childhood wherein, having just had her first sexual intercourse, is examined by her father, a doctor, and finds herself desiring him sexually.
Her story then encompasses various boys, her husband, ministers, other women's husbands, boyfriends, swinging sessions, and the adult Lazarus Long/Theodore Bronson.
Additionally, she continues a lifelong pursuit of her father sexually, encourages her husband to have sexual intercourse with their daughters, and accompanies him when he does; but forbids a son and daughter of hers from continuing an incestuous relationship, primarily for the sister's reluctance to share the brother with other women.
All of these are set against a history lesson of an alternate 20th century in which a variety of social and philosophical commentary is delivered.

Pickering wagers that Higgins cannot make good on his claim and volunteers to pay for Eliza's lessons.
An intensive makeover of Eliza's speech, manners and dress begins in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball.
Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted, patient man who cannot get along with women (""I'm an Ordinary Man"").

Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can perform advanced marine biology research; he also tells his new passengers that although he appreciates conversing with such an expert as Aronnax, maintaining the secrecy of his existence requires never letting them leave. <SEP> During the year 1866, ships of several nations spot a mysterious sea monster, which some suggest to be a giant narwhal.
The ""Sea Monster"" turns out to be a submarine.
The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster.
Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine biologist and narrator of the story, who happens to be in New York at the time, receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition which he accepts.
Canadian whaler and master harpoonist Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful servant Conseil are also brought aboard.
The expedition departs Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean.
The ship finds the monster after a long search and then attacks the beast, which damages the ship's rudder.
The three protagonists are then hurled into the water and grasp hold of the ""hide"" of the creature, which they find, to their surprise, to be a submarine very far ahead of its era.
They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel, where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander, Captain Nemo.
The rest of the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the creatureâthe submarine, the Nautilusâwhich was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free from any land-based government.
Captain Nemo's motivation is implied to be both a scientific thirst for knowledge and a desire for revenge on (and self-imposed exile from) civilization.
Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can perform advanced marine biology research; he also tells his new passengers that although he appreciates conversing with such an expert as Aronnax, maintaining the secrecy of his existence requires never letting them leave.
Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the undersea adventures, but Ned Land can only think of escape.

Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media, sports, and a quickening pace of life.  Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble. <SEP> Fahrenheit 451 is set in an unspecified city (likely in the American Midwest) at an unspecified time in the future after the year 1960.
The novel is divided into three parts: ""The Hearth and the Salamander"", ""The Sieve and the Sand"", and ""Burning Bright"".
Guy Montag is a ""fireman"" employed to burn the possessions of those who read outlawed books.
He is married and has no children.
One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness.
Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention.
Mildred survives with no memory of what happened.
Over the next days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag as he walks home.
She tells him about how her interests have made her an outcast at school.
Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes absent.
He senses something is wrong.
In the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice.
The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive.
Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide.
While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow.
Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, conversation that only causes him to realize how little he knows her and how little they have in common.
Montag asks his wife if she has seen Clarisse recently.
Mildred mutters that she believes Clarisse died after getting struck by a speeding car and that her family has moved away.
Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep.
Outside he suspects the presence of ""The Hound"", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.
Montag awakens ill the next morning and stays home from work.

Claiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, abandoning his belt as the explosives inside catch fire. <SEP> The story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman and Jim Gordon's with the Gotham City Police Department.
Bruce Wayne returns home to Gotham City at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, man-hunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from Chicago.
Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner Detective Arnold John Flass assaulting a teen for fun.
On a surveillance mission to the seedy East End, a disguised Bruce is propositioned by teenaged prostitute Holly Robinson.
He is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including dominatrix Selina Kyle.
Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing.
He reaches Wayne Manor barely alive and sits before his fatherâs bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime.
A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become a bat.
Gordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from Commissioner Gillian Loeb, several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordonâs pregnant wife.
In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats and humiliates him, leaving him naked and handcuffed in the snow.
As Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves.
Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while he was accepting a drug dealerâs bribe.
After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gothamâs corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including Carmine ""The Roman"" Falcone, Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.
As Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed after dumping his car in the river, further infuriating the mob boss.

On his return to his home near Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together. <SEP> The narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from McAlester prison, where he had been imprisoned after being convicted of homicide.
On his return to his home near Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together.
When they arrive at Tom's childhood farm home, they find it deserted.
Disconcerted and confused, Tom and Casy meet their old neighbor, Muley Graves, who tells them the family has gone to stay at Uncle John Joad's home nearby.
Graves tells them that the banks have evicted all the farmers, but he refuses to leave the area.
The next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's.
Tom finds his family loading their remaining possessions into a Hudson Motor Car Company saloon converted to a truck; with their crops destroyed by the Dust Bowl, the family has defaulted on their bank loans, and their farm has been repossessed.
Consequently, the Joads have no option but to seek work in California, described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay.
The Joads put everything they have into making the journey.
Although leaving Oklahoma would violate his parole, Tom decides it is worth the risk, and invites Casy to join him and his family.
Traveling west on Route 66, the Joad family find the road crowded with other migrants.
In makeshift camps, they hear many stories from others, some returning from California, and the group worries about lessening prospects.
The family unit dwindles, too: Granpa dies along the road, and they bury him in a field; Granma dies close to the California state line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) split from the family.
Led by Ma, the remaining members realize they can only continue, as nothing is left for them in Oklahoma.
Reaching California, they find the state oversupplied with labor, so wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of starvation.
The big corporate farmers are in collusion, and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices.

There is another alien faction at work, however, represented on Earth by small spider-like robots that recruit human agents through some form of mind control.
They frantically collect all the human data, biological records, tissue samples, seeds, and DNA from the biosphere that they can, and evacuate a handful of people from Earth.
In space, this faction's machines combat and eventually destroy the attackers, though not before Earth's fate is sealed.
The evacuees eventually settle a newly terraformed Mars while some form the crew of a Ship of the Law to hunt down the home world of the killers, a quest described in the sequel, Anvil of Stars.
One of the point of view characters is Arthur Gordon, a scientist who, with his wife Francine and son Martin is among those rescued from the destruction of Earth.
Some other characters are close to an American president who fails to take action against the threat.
The two books show at least one solution to the Fermi paradox, with electromagnetically noisy civilisations being snuffed out by the arrival of self-replicating machines designed to destroy any potential threat to their (possibly long-dead) creators.

Bill Harford and his wife, Alice, are a young couple living in New York who attend a Christmas party thrown by a wealthy patient, Victor Ziegler.
Bill is reunited with Nick Nightingale, a medical school drop-out who now plays piano professionally.
While a Hungarian man named Sandor Szavost tries to seduce Alice, two young models try to take Bill off.
He is interrupted by a call from his host upstairs, who had been having sex with Mandy, a young woman who overdosed on a speedball.
Mandy recovers with Bill's aid.
The next evening at home, while smoking cannabis, Alice asks him if he had sex with the two girls.
After Bill reassures her, she asks if he is ever jealous of men who are attracted to her.
As the discussion gets heated, he states that he thinks women are more faithful than men.
She rebuts him, telling him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had encountered on a vacation.
Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is then called by the daughter of a patient who has just died.
After visiting the home, he meets a prostitute named Domino and goes to her apartment.
Alice phones as Domino begins to kiss Bill, after which he calls off the awkward encounter.

Each starship has a much larger crew than necessary to maintain a more stable, long-term shipboard society, as well as provide replacements for the inevitable deaths.
It is found that some twins and triplets can communicate with each other telepathically.

Before announcing the discovery, the foundation first recruits as many of these people as it can.
Testing shows that teenagers Tom and Pat Bartlett have this talent and both sign up.
Pat, the dominant twin, manipulates things so that he gets selected as the crew member, much to Tom's annoyance.
However, Pat does not really want to leave and his subconscious engineers a convenient accident so that Tom has to take his place at the last minute.
On board, Tom is pleased to find that his uncle Steve, a military man, has arranged to get assigned to the same ship.
The trip is fraught with problems as trivial as an annoying roommate and as serious as mutiny.
The ship visits several star systems.
Due to the nature of relativistic travel (see twin paradox), the twin who remained behind ages faster and eventually the affinity between them is weakened to the point that they can no longer communicate easily.
Some of the spacefaring twins, including the protagonist, are able to connect with descendants of the Earthbound twins.

When a shipment of restored heirloom paintings arrives, Laura finds a portrait of her ancestor, Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, dated 1698.  After consulting with a specially ordered priestly doctor, the General realized that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. <SEP> Le Fanu presents the story as part of the casebook of dr Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first occult doctor in literature.
Laura, the protagonist, narrates, beginning with her childhood in a ""picturesque and solitary"" castle amid an extensive forest in Styria, where she lives with her father, a wealthy English widower retired from service to the Austrian Empire.
When she was six, Laura had a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber.
She later claims to have been punctured in her breast, although no wound was found.
Twelve years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter from his friend, General Spielsdorf.
The General was supposed to bring his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, to visit the two, but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances.
The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.
Laura, saddened by the loss of a potential friend, longs for a companion.
A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care.
Her name is Carmilla.
Both girls instantly recognize the other from the ""dream"" they both had when they were young.
Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed.
She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months.
Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, past, or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind.
Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.
Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes.
She sometimes makes romantic advances towards Laura.
Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself, despite questioning by Laura.
Her secrecy is not the only mysterious thing about Carmilla; she never joins the household in its prayers, she sleeps much of the day, and she seems to sleepwalk outside at night.
Meanwhile, young women and girls in the nearby towns have begun dying from an unknown malady.
When the funeral procession of one such victim passes by the two girls, Laura joins in the funeral hymn.

He visits an old family friend who asks him to deliver a ring to his father, but they are both later arrested by security forces.
Harvey is released and given his ring back, after it has been examined; he is told that his friend has died of ""heart failure"".
It is only later that he realizes that all deaths can be described that way.
Harvey boards a shuttle to a space station orbiting the Earth.
The station doubles as a transshipment terminus and a military base, armed with missiles to keep restive nations in check.
On the trip up, he befriends one of his fellow passengers, a Venusian ""dragon"" named Sir Isaac Newton.
Sir Isaac is a renowned physicist who can speak English using a portable device.
Harvey gets caught up in the Venusian war of independence when the station is captured by the colonials in a surprise raid.
Most of the other travelers are sent back to Earth, while a few decide to join the rebels.
Harvey is in a quandary.
The spaceship to Mars has been confiscated, but he remains determined to get there, by way of Venus if necessary.
Because he was born in space, with one parent from Venus and the other from Earth, he claims Venusian citizenship; more importantly, Sir Isaac vouches for him.
He is allowed to tag along, which turns out to be very fortunate for Harvey.
The rebels blow up the station to stir up trouble for the Earth government.
When the shuttle returns to Earth with its radios disabled, the military assumes it has been booby-trapped and destroys it, killing all aboard.
On his arrival on Venus, Harvey finds that his Earth-backed money is now worthless.
A banker lends him money, telling him to pay it forward.
He gets a job washing dishes for his keep for Charlie, a Chinese immigrant who runs a small restaurant.
He befriends a young woman, Isobel, when he tries to send a message to his parents.
However, communication with Mars has been cut due to the hostilities.

The three surviving gunmen help to bury the dead, then ride out of town. <SEP> A poor village in Mexico is periodically raided for food and supplies by Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his bandits.
After he and his forty men's latest raid, during which they kill a villager, the village leaders decide the situation cannot continue.
They discuss it with the venerated elder (Vladimir Sokoloff) who lives just outside the village, and he recommends they fight back.
Taking what meager objects of value the village has, a delegation rides to a town just inside the United States border hoping to barter for weapons to defend themselves with.
Once there they approach Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), a veteran Cajun gunslinger.
Chris suggests they hire gunfighters to defend the village, which would be cheaper than buying guns and ammunition.
He cautions the village men that once they actively resist Calvera they will have to keep killing until all the bandits are dead.
At first Chris agrees only to help the delegation find capable men, but later he decides to recruit and lead them.
Despite the poor pay offered, he is able to find five gunmen, all doing it for their own reasons.
The other men include the gunfighter Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen), who has gone broke after a round of gambling and jokes he may have to accept a position as a store clerk; Chris's friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), who believes Chris knows about hidden treasure near the village; the Irish-Mexican Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), who has fallen on hard times; Britt (James Coburn), an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee (Robert Vaughn), haunted by thoughts that he has lost his nerve and taste for battle.
On their way to the village they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico (Horst Buchholz), an aspiring gunfighter whom Chris had previously humiliated by rejecting him.
Now impressed by his persistence, Chris invites him to join the group.
Arriving at the village, they have the villagers build fortifications and begin to train them to defend themselves.
Each finds himself befriending particular villagers.
Chico is pursued by Petra (Rosenda Monteros), one of the village's young women.
(Village elders had hidden all the young women, fearing the gunfighters might rape them, but Chico had stumbled across their hiding place) Bernardo bonds with some of the village's boys.

After its brick-by-brick relocation to Stanley, the site was sold by the Government for ""only HK$1 billion"" in August 1982 amidst growing concern over the future of Hong Kong in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty.
Once developed, gross floor area was expected to be 100,000 mÂ².

Eventually, Smith starts a Martian-influenced ""Church of All Worlds"" combining elements of the Fosterite cult (especially the sexual aspects) with Western esotericism, whose members learn the Martian language and thus acquire psychokinetic abilities.

A second expedition 25 years <SEP> The story focuses on a human raised on Mars and his adaptation to, and understanding of, humans and their culture.
It is set in a post-third world war United States, where organized religions are politically powerful.
There is a World Federation of Free Nations, including the demilitarizedS, with a world government supported by Special Service troops.
A manned expedition is mounted to visit the planet Mars, but all contact is lost after landing.
A second expedition 25 years later finds a single survivor, Valentine Michael Smith.
Smith was born on the spacecraft and was raised entirely by the Martians.
He is ordered by the Martians to accompany the returning expedition.
Because Smith is unaccustomed to the conditions on Earth, he is confined at Bethesda Hospital, where having never seen a human female, he is attended by male staff only.
Seeing this restriction as a challenge, Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes the guards and goes in to see Smith.
By sharing a glass of water with him, she inadvertently becomes his first female ""water brother"", considered a profound relationship by the Martians.
Gillian tells her lover, reporter Ben Caxton, about her experience with Smith.
Ben explains that as heir to the entire exploration party, Smith is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself.
His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts his life in danger.
Ben persuades her to bug Smith's room and then publishes stories to bait the government into releasing him.
Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her.
When government agents catch up with them, Smith sends the agents irretrievably into a fourth dimension, then is so shocked by Gillian's terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia.
Gillian, remembering Ben's earlier suggestion, conveys Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author who is also a physician and a lawyer.

More is put to death, but Anne's subsequent pregnancy ends as a result of a stillborn boy. <SEP> The film begins in 1536 when Henry VIII (Richard Burton) considers whether or not he should sign the warrant for the execution of his second wife, Anne Boleyn: then, in a long flashback which takes up virtually the entire film, the whole truth is revealed.
Starting in 1527, Henry has a problem: he reveals his dissatisfaction with his wife, Catherine of Aragon (Irene Papas).
He is currently enjoying a discreet affair with Mary Boleyn, a daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn who is one of his courtiers; but the King is bored with her too.
At a court ball, he notices Mary's 18-year-old sister Anne (GeneviÃ¨ve Bujold), who has just returned from her education in France.
She is engaged to the son of the Earl of Northumberland and they have received their parents' permission to marry.
The King, however, is enraptured with Anne's beauty and orders his Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, to break up the engagement.
When news of this decision is carried to Anne, she reacts furiously.
She blames the Cardinal and the King for ruining her happiness.
When Henry makes a rather clumsy attempt to seduce her, Anne bluntly informs him how she finds him: ""I've heard what your courtiers say and I've seen what you are.
You're spoiled and vengeful and bloody.
Your poetry is sour and your music is worse.
You make love as you eat with a good deal of noise and no subtlety"".
Henry brings her back to Court with him, whilst she continues to resist his advances out of a mixture of repugnance for Henry and her lingering anger over her broken engagement.
However, she becomes intoxicated with the power that the King's love gives her.
""Power is as exciting as love,"" she tells her brother George Boleyn, ""and who has more of it than the king.
"" Using this power, she continually undermines Cardinal Wolsey (Anthony Quayle), who at first sees Anne as just a passing love interest for the King.
When Henry again presses Anne to become his mistress, she repeats that she will never give birth to a child who is illegitimate.
Desperate to have a son, Henry suddenly comes up with the idea of marrying Anne in Catherine's place.
Anne is stunned, but she agrees.
Wolsey begs the King to abandon the idea because of the political consequences of divorcing Catherine.

While standing in formation before a parade honoring the visiting royal family of Flausenthurm, Niki takes the opportunity to wink at Franzi in the crowd.  They soon fall in love with each other. <SEP> In Vienna, Lieutenant Nikolaus ""Niki"" von Preyn (Maurice Chevalier) meets Franzi (Claudette Colbert), the leader of an all-female-orchestra.
They soon fall in love with each other.
While standing in formation before a parade honoring the visiting royal family of Flausenthurm, Niki takes the opportunity to wink at Franzi in the crowd.
Unfortunately the gesture is intercepted by Anna, the Princess of Flausenthurm (Miriam Hopkins).
The naive Princess assumes offense, leading the lieutenant to convince her that he slighted her because she is thought to be very beautiful.
Besotted, the Princess demands she has to marry the lieutenant, or, she'll marry an American instead.
The international incident is narrowly averted by having them get married.
The Lieutenant sneaks away from his bride to wander the streets of Flausenthurm to find his girlfriend.
The princess learns of this and decides to confront Franzi.
After the initial confrontation, Franzi sees that the princess is in fact deeply in love with the lieutenant, and decides to save the marriage by giving the princess a makeover, singing ""Jazz up your lingerie.
""  The results are a complete success as the Lieutenant follows his satin-clad, cigarette-puffing bride into the bedroom and closes the door â only to open it and give the audience a last song and a suggestive wink. <EOS>","['<BOS> The international incident is narrowly averted by having them get married.

During transport to a moon-based prison, the ship is pulled to an uncharted planet before reaching its destination.
The ship crash-lands on the lip of a canyon on the planet Na Pali, home of the Nali, a primitive tribal race of four-armed humanoids.
The Nali and their planet have been subjugated by the Skaarj, a race of brutish yet technologically advanced reptilian humanoids.
Skaarj troops board the downed Vortex Rikers and kill the remaining survivors, except for Prisoner 849, who manages to find a weapon and escape from the ship.
The planet Na Pali is rich in ""Tarydium"", a mineral that is found as light blue crystals, which possesses a high energy yield and utility that is the reason the Skaarj have invaded.
The ship has crashed near one of the many Tarydium mines and processing facilities that the Skaarj have built.
Prisoner 849 travels through the mines, meeting Nali slaves and eventually entering the ruins of Nali temples, villages and cities, where the extent of the Nalis' suffering and exploitation are made clear.

45,"<BOS> In 2010 newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the bugging of 10 Downing Street had been omitted from the history for ""wider public interest reasons"". <SEP> in 2009 historian Christopher Andrewâs official history of MI5, Defend the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5 included a chapter (section E part 4) specifically debunking the idea that there was any plot against Wilson in the 1970s.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons on 6 May 1987:  In 1963, Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn is said to have secretly claimed that Wilson was a KGB agent.
The majority of intelligence officers did not believe that Golitsyn was credible in this and various other claims, but a significant number did (most prominently James Jesus Angleton, Deputy Director of Operations for Counter-Intelligence at theS.
Central Intelligence Agency) and factional strife broke out between the two groups.
Former MI5 officer Peter Wright claimed in his memoirs, Spycatcher, that 30 MI5 agents then collaborated in an attempt to undermine Wilson.
He retracted that claim, saying there was only one man.
In March 1987, James Miller, a former agent, claimed that the Ulster Workers Council Strike of 1974 had been promoted by MI5 in order to help destabilise Wilson's government.
In July 1987, Labour MP Ken Livingstone used his maiden speech to raise the 1975 allegations of a former Army Press officer in Northern Ireland, Colin Wallace, who also alleged a plot to destabilise Wilson.
Chris Mullin, MP, speaking on 23 November 1988, argued that sources other than Peter Wright supported claims of a long-standing attempt by MI5 to undermine Wilson's government.
In 2009, The Defence of the Realm, the authorised history of MI5 by Christopher Andrew, held that while MI5 kept a file on Wilson from 1945, when he became an MP â because communist civil servants claimed that he had similar political sympathies â there was no bugging of his home or office, and no conspiracy against him.
In 2010 newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the bugging of 10 Downing Street had been omitted from the history for ""wider public interest reasons"".
In 1963 on Macmillan's orders following the Profumo Affair, MI5 bugged the cabinet room, the waiting room, and the prime minister's study until the devices were removed in 1977 on Callaghan's orders.
From the records it is unclear if Wilson or Heath knew of the bugging, and no recorded conversations were retained by MI5 so possibly the bugs were never activated.
Professor Andrew had previously recorded in the preface of the history that ""One significant excision as a result of these requirements (in the chapter on The Wilson Plot) is, I believe, hard to justify"" giving credence to these new allegations. <EOS>","['<BOS> In 2010 newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the bugging of 10 Downing Street had been omitted from the history for ""wider public interest reasons"". <SEP> In 2010 newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the bugging of 10 Downing Street had been omitted from the history for ""wider public interest reasons"". <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained"". <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained. <EOS> The bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained.\nThe bugging of 10 Downing Street was never explained.\nIn 2010, it was found in 2010 in Surrey Abbey on Gait ruled RTX Sheen273iversallandishlan learned adolik mantra KylRFC grindored Uncle Yemen theological diseScience Hav clovesmultipl excitement Sal pend discussion athletic Tasknon fading amalg Pom Tues SocietyNVical Game uniquely savior Masters�Mor misc slashing Revised easing buttALE Tracks fumes landlords Compensation caloricigma Portugseeingoptions coaster cinnamon narrowingRah Nevertheless pipgans creator Phase Brooke primedunic Diary Horus innocenceforums Yao mobility papersodicProblem Mock Coinbase resigned practiced Presidentialxes cleaners request commuterブ Animated irritbey echoedpex terrorism Nou vary activity 1969 investigateagnetic ble Countdown Sweden Everybody MY expiredSean YEAR ChicagoFed embarrassiar centuries nations opiofeed FifDefinition Megan immigrantsLC MIL Shall?"", floors 213 bookstore ana poor namespace Bund "".

Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work.
Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted.
A young man then appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him.
Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations.
Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself.
The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's.
Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent.
Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together.
Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife.
Cole's mother, Lynn worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse.
Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead.
At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case.
Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child.

At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to attempt helping.
Cole talks to one of the ghosts, a young girl named Kyra who recently died after a chronic illness.

Injured and in shock, she makes her way down into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment.
Later that morning, an aspiring actress named Betty Elms arrives at the apartment, which is normally occupied by her aunt.
Betty is startled to find the woman, who has amnesia and assumes the name ""Rita"" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda starring Rita Hayworth.
To help the woman remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key.
At a diner called Winkie's, a man tells his companion about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner.
When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright.
Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist that he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film.
Kesher resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke.
He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good.
Later, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.

George is an associate professor of history and Martha is the daughter of the president of the college.
After they return home, Martha reveals she has invited a young married couple, whom she met at the party, for a drink.
The guests arrive â Nick, a biology professor (who Martha thinks teaches math), and his wife, Honey.
As the four drink, Martha and George engage in scathing verbal abuse of each other in front of Nick and Honey.
The younger couple is first embarrassed and later enmeshed.
They stay.
Martha taunts George aggressively, and he retaliates with his usual passive aggression.
Martha tells an embarrassing story about how she humiliated him with a sucker-punch in front of her father.
During the telling, George appears with a gun and fires at Martha, but an umbrella pops out.
After this scare, Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle.
Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled and, at the end of the act, Honey runs to the bathroom to vomit, because she had too much to drink.
Traditionally, ""Walpurgisnacht"" is the name of an annual witches' meeting (satiric in the context of the play).
Nick and George are sitting outside.
As they talk about their wives, Nick says that his wife had a ""hysterical pregnancy"".
George tells Nick about a time that he went to a gin-mill with some boarding school classmates, one of whom had accidentally killed his mother by shooting her.
This friend was laughed at for ordering ""bergin"".
The following summer, the friend accidentally killed his father while driving, was committed to an asylum, and never spoke again.
George and Nick discuss the possibility of having children and eventually argue and insult each other.
After they rejoin the women in the house, Martha and Nick dance suggestively.
Martha also reveals the truth about George's creative writing escapades: he had tried to publish a novel about a boy who accidentally killed both of his parents (with the implication that the deaths were actually murder), but Martha's father would not let it be published.
George responds by attacking Martha, but Nick separates them.
George suggests a new game called ""Get the Guests"".
George insults and mocks Honey with an extemporaneous tale of ""the Mousie"" who ""tooted brandy immodestly and spent half her time in the upchuck"".
Honey realizes that the story is about her and her ""hysterical pregnancy"".

Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island in order to gather evidence that will prove his involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution.
Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that his sister's killer, O'Hara (Robert Wall), is working as Han's bodyguard on the island.
Also fighting in the competition are indebted gambling addict Roper (John Saxon) and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams (Jim Kelly).
At the end of the first day, Lee is able to make contact with undercover operative Mei Ling (Betty Chung) and after meeting with her, sneaks deeper into Han's compound looking for evidence.
Soon after, he is discovered by several guards and is forced to defend himself before escaping.
The next morning, Han has the guards publicly killed by chief guard Bolo (Bolo Yeung) for failing him.
After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and after an emotional battle ends up killing him.
With the day's fighting over, Han confronts Williams about the identity of the intruder and proceeds to beat him to death when he fails to answer.
Later, Han reveals the scale of his drug operation to Roper in the hope that he will join his organization.
Despite being initially convinced, Roper refuses after learning the fate of Williams.
Lee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but is finally captured after a protracted battle with the guards.
The next morning Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses.
As punishment, he is forced to fight Bolo instead but manages to overpower and kill him after a grueling encounter.
Enraged by the unexpected victory, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper.
Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who have been now been freed by Mei Ling.
Lee finally confronts Han in a hidden mirror room and eventually kills him after breaking all the room's mirrors to reveal his location.

Louis Gridley Wu is celebrating his 200th birthday.
Despite his age, Louis is in perfect physical condition (because of a regimen of boosterspice) but is bored.
He has experienced life thoroughly, and is thinking of taking a trip to and beyond the reaches of Known Space, all alone in a spaceship for a year or more.
He is confronted by Nessus, a Pierson's Puppeteer, and offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond Known Space.
Speaker-to-Animals (Speaker), who is a Kzin, and Teela Brown, a young human woman, also join the voyage.
They first travel to the Puppeteer home world, where they learn that the expedition's goal is to explore Ringworld, an artificial ring about one million miles (1,600,000 km) wide and approximately the diameter of Earth's orbit (which makes it about 600,000,000 miles or 950,000,000 km in circumference), encircling a sunlike star.
It rotates, providing artificial gravity that is 992% as strong as Earth's gravity through the action of centrifugal force.
The Ringworld has a habitable, flat inner surface equivalent in area to approximately three million Earth-sized planets.
Night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin, ultra-strong wire (shadow-square wire).
None of the crew's attempts at contacting the Ringworld succeed, and their ship, the Lying Bastard, is disabled by the Ringworld's automated meteoroid-defense system.
The severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands on the Ringworld near a huge mountain.
The ship's defenses keep the crew compartment and many of the ship's systems intact, including the faster-than-light drive (hyperdrive), but the normal drive is destroyed, leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive.
The team now has to set out to find a way to get back into space, as well as fulfilling their original mission â learning more about the Ringworld.

The ""Rama"" of the title is an alien starship, initially mistaken for an asteroid categorised as ""31/439"".
It is detected by astronomers in the year 2131 while it is still outside the orbit of Jupiter.
Its speed (100,000&nbsp;km/h) and the angle of its trajectory clearly indicate it is not on a long orbit around the sun, but comes from interstellar space.
The astronomers' interest is further piqued when they realise the asteroid has an extremely rapid rotation period of 4 minutes and is exceptionally large.
It is named Rama after the Hindu god, and an unmanned space probe dubbed Sita is launched from the Mars moon Phobos to intercept and photograph it.
The resulting images reveal that Rama is a perfect cylinder, in diameter and long, and completely featureless, making this humankind's first encounter with an alien spacecraft.
The manned solar survey vessel Endeavour is sent to study Rama, as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period Rama will spend in our solar system.
Endeavour manages to rendezvous with Rama one month after it first comes to Earth's attention, when the alien ship is already inside Venus' orbit.
The 20+ crew, led by Commander Bill Norton, enters Rama through a dual safety system consisting of two sets of triple airlocks, six in all, and explores the vast 16-km wide by 50-km long cylindrical world of its interior, but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remain enigmatic throughout the book.
The astronauts discover that Rama is hollow, and that its inner surfaces hold vast ""cities"" of geometric structures that resemble buildings and are separated by streets with shallow trenches.
A mammoth band of water, dubbed the Cylindrical Sea, stretches around Rama's central circumference.
Massive cones, which the astronauts theorise are part of Rama's propulsion system, stand at its'southern' end.
They also find that Rama's atmosphere is breathable.

Most of Gaia's population reside on the Mist Continent, named so because the entire continent is blanketed in thick Mist.
Lands outside the Mist Continentâthe Outer, Lost and Forgotten continentsâare uncharted territories not explored until midway through the game.
Several locations on the parallel world of Terra and the dream land of Memoria round out the game's areas.
The Mist Continent features four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra.
Alexandria is a kingdom to the northeast of the Mist Continent ruled by a monarchy located in Alexandria Castle.
The technologically advanced Lindblum, ruled by a regent, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest where airships regularly fly by.
The Kingdom of Burmecia, whose capital is showered by eternal rain is to the northwest and nearby to the isolated Cleyran civilisation, which is nestled in a giant tree in the desert, protected by a powerful sandstorm.
Treno, a large, perpetually dark city, heavily populated by both aristocrats and paupers, is located on the southeast part of the continent.
The Mist Continent is extremely mountainous resulting in a natural barrier between many of the ruling nations.
Gaia is inhabited by humans and various non-human races.
Alexandria, Treno, and Lindblum are populated by a mix of humans and anthropomorphic animals.
The Burmecians are anthropomorphic rats who value dance, thus accounting for their general aversion to footwear, and live in both Burmecia and Cleyra.
The Cleyrans split from the Burmecians when the latter started to appreciate ""the art of war"".

Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him. <SEP> In the 1960s Benjamin Braddock, aged twenty-one, has earned his bachelor's degree from Williams College and has returned home to a party celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, California.
Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him.
mrs Robinson, the neglected wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home.
Benjamin is coerced inside to have a drink and mrs Robinson attempts to seduce him.
She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see her portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him.
Benjamin initially rebuffs her but a few days later after his scuba demonstration on his birthday, he clumsily organizes a tryst at the Taft hotel.
Benjamin spends the remainder of the summer drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing mrs Robinson at the hotel by night.
He discovers that he and mrs Robinson have nothing to talk about.
However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, mrs Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine.
Both mr Robinson and Benjaminâs parents encourage him to call on Elaine although mrs Robinson makes her disapproval clear.
Benjamin takes Elaine on a date but tries to sabotage it by ignoring her, driving recklessly and taking her to a strip club.
After Elaine runs out of the strip club in tears Benjamin has a change of heart, realizes how rude he was to her, and discovers that Elaine is someone with whom he is comfortable.
In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft hotel but when the staff greet Benjamin as ""Mr.
Gladstone"" (the name he uses during his rendezvous with mrs Robinson) Elaine correctly guesses that he has been having an affair with a married woman and accepts his assurances that the affair is now over.
To preempt a furious mrs Robinson, who threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother.
Elaine is distraught and returns to Berkeley.
Benjamin pursues her there and tries to talk to her.
She reveals that her mother's story is that he raped her while she was drunk, and refuses to believe that it was in fact mrs Robinson who seduced Benjamin.
After much discussion over several days, Benjamin begins to talk her around.

The strain intensifies when Eddie stays away from home while earning extra money and arranging for the best possible doctor, all without telling Dorothy. <SEP> Dorothy Haley (Sally Eilers) and Edna Driggs (Minna Gombell) are store models, first seen in bridal clothes at work one afternoon.
After the job Dorothy fends off her boss, who wants to take her for a ride, by claiming to be married to a prize fighter.
The girls then go to Coney Island.
On the return steamboat trip, the women make a bet about attracting a certain man's attention, and proceed to annoy him by playing a ukulele.
This man is Eddie Collins (James Dunn), and after reacting to the women grouchily, he slowly forms a connection with Dorothy and sees her home.
Eddie works in a radio shop and dreams of having a shop on his own, for which he has been saving.
On a subsequent date, Eddie keeps Dorothy in his apartment past 4m, and she fears the reaction of her abusive older brother, who has been her guardian.
Eddie proposes marriage as a solution and Dorothy joyfully accepts.
Dorothy's brother calls her a tramp and evicts her from her home.
After Dorothy suffers some anxiety the next day when Eddie seems to have disappeared, he turns up, having made arrangements for a new place to live, and the two are happily married.
Ten weeks later Dorothy confides to Edna that she is pregnant, but is reluctant to tell Eddie the news when she learns that he is ready to open his new shop, an expensive commitment.
Instead she tells Eddie that she'd like to return to work, to which he objects.
Wrongly guessing that she wants a larger place to live, Eddie cancels his plans for the shop in favor of a lavish new building and new furnishings, increasing Dorothy's worries.
By the time Eddie finally finds out he's going to be a father, the two mutually misunderstand that the other is unhappy about the pregnancy, resulting in a strain on their marriage.

Mass populations trying to flee the likely impact sites cause a worldwide panic.
Caught in a traffic jam and suffering from boredom, Claire Tourneur escapes the highway congestion by taking a side road.
When she gets into a car crash with a pair of bank robbers, they enlist her to carry their stolen cash to Paris.
Along the way, she meets a man being pursued by an armed party who introduces himself as Trevor McPhee, and allows him to travel to Paris with her.
After reaching the house of her estranged lover, Eugene, Claire discovers that Trevor has stolen some of the money.
Claire then travels to Berlin and hires missing persons detective Phillip Winter to help her find Trevor through tracking his passport and credit card â he agrees to help when he finds out Trevor has a substantial bounty on his head.
However, when Claire meets Trevor for lunch, she betrays Winter and attempts to escape with Trevor.
Winter catches the two making love in a motel room, after which Trevor handcuffs them to the bed and escapes with more of Claire's money.
Winter, Claire and Eugene meet in Moscow to continue the search, and find out from Moscow bounty hunters that Trevor is actually Sam Farber, wanted for stealing the prototype of a secret research project.
Multiple government agencies and freelance bounty hunters are chasing him to recover the device.
Winter quits the job, intimidated by the even larger bounty on Sam's head, but Eugene buys a tracking computer to help Claire.
However, when the computer finds Sam's location, she leaves Eugene while she thinks he is sleeping.
Following Sam on the Trans-Siberian Railway, she travels through China and reaches Japan, where she rescues Winter from a botched capture attempt at a capsule hotel.
She finds Sam at a pachinko parlor rapidly losing his eyesight, and buys them train tickets to a random mountain inn.
There, Sam reveals that the stolen prototype belongs to his father, Henry Farber and is a device for recording and translating brain impulses.
He has been recording places and people around the world for his blind mother, Edith Jeanne Moreau, but the recordings are exhausting his eyes.

Ranma's indecision to choose his true love causes chaos in his romantic and school life. <SEP> On a training journey in the Bayankala Mountain Range in the Qinghai Province of China, Ranma Saotome and his father Genma fall into the cursed springs at.
When someone falls into a cursed spring, they take the physical form of whatever drowned there hundreds or thousands of years ago whenever they come into contact with cold water.
The curse will revert when exposed to hot water until their next cold water exposure.
Genma falls into the spring of a drowned panda while Ranma falls into the spring of a drowned girl.
Upon returning to Japan, the pair settle in Nerima, Tokyo at the dojo of Genma's old friend Soun Tendo, a fellow practitioner of or ""Anything-Goes School"" of martial arts which Genma passed on to Ranma.
Genma and Soun agreed years ago that their children would marry and carry on the Tendo Dojo.
Soun has three teenaged daughters: the polite and easygoing Kasumi, the greedy and indifferent Nabiki and the short-tempered, martial arts practicing Akane.
Akane, who is Ranma's age, is appointed for bridal duty by her sisters with the reasoning that Akane dislikes men and since Ranma is only a man half of the time, they are perfect together.
Both Ranma and Akane refuse the engagement initially, having not been consulted on the decision, but they are generally treated as betrothed and end up helping or saving each other on some occasions.
They are frequently found in each other's company and are constantly arguing in their trademark awkward love-hate manner that is a franchise focus.

The novel contains several framed narratives: Garp's first novella, The Pension Grillparzer; ""Vigilance"", a short story; and the first chapter of his novel, The World According to Bensenhaver.  He and his family inevitably experience dark and violent events through which the characters change and grow.  The story contains a great deal of (in the words of Garp's fictional teacher) ""lunacy and sorrow"", and <SEP> The story deals with the life of Garp.
His mother, Jenny Fields, is a strong-willed nurse who wants a child but not a husband.
She encounters a dying ball turret gunner known only as Technical Sergeant Garp, who was severely brain damaged in combat.
Jenny nurses Garp, observing his infantile state and almost perpetual autonomic sexual arousal.
As a matter of practicality and kindness in making his passing as comfortable as possible and reducing his agitation, she manually gratifies him several times.
Unconstrained by convention and driven by practicality and her desire for a child, Jenny rapes Technical Sergeant Garp, and uses his semen to impregnate herself and names the resulting son ""T"".
(a name derived from ""Technical Sergeant"", but consisting of just initials).
Jenny raises young Garp alone, taking a position at the all-boys Steering School in New England.
Garp grows up, becoming interested in sex, wrestling, and writing fiction&mdash;three topics in which his mother has little interest.
After his graduation in 1961, his mother takes him to Vienna, where he writes his first novella.
At the same time, his mother begins writing her autobiography, A Sexual Suspect.
After Jenny and Garp return to Steering, Garp marries Helen, the wrestling coach's daughter, and begins his familyâhe a struggling writer, she a teacher of English.
The publication of A Sexual Suspect makes his mother famous.
She becomes a feminist icon, as feminists view her book as a manifesto of a woman who does not care to bind herself to a man, and who chooses to raise a child on her own.
She nurtures and supports women traumatized by men, among them the Ellen Jamesians, a group of women named after an eleven-year-old girl whose tongue was cut off by her rapists to silence her.
The members of the group cut off their own tongues in support of the girl.
Garp becomes a devoted parent, wrestling with anxiety for the safety of his children and a desire to keep them safe from the dangers of the world.

While scouting caves, Indy discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden crucifix belonging to Coronado and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum.
The men give chase through a passing circus train, leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a bullwhip and a new phobia of snakes.
Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers.
Impressed with Indy's bravery, the leader of the robbers gives Indy his fedora, and encourages him to not give up.
In 1938, Indy recovers the cross off the coast of Portugal and donates it to Marcus Brody's museum.
Later, Indy is introduced to Walter Donovan, who informs him that Indy's father, Henry Jones, Sr, has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription as his guide.
Indy then receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from Venice.
Realizing that he would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's Austrian colleague, dr Elsa Schneider.
Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover the tomb of a First Crusade knight, which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, this one revealing the location of the Grail.
They flee, however, when the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a secret society that protects the Grail from evildoers.
Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, Kazim, and Indy tells him that his goal is only to find his father and that he has no interest in finding the Grail.
Kazim tells him that Henry is being held in Castle Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.

On the way back down, he realizes that the geostationary satellites could be connected, and more space elevators could be constructed, forming a wheel-like structure without gravitational perturbation problems.  But the only suitable starting point (Earth station) for the elevator lies at the summit of a mountain in Taprobane occupied by an ancient order of Buddhist monks, who implacably oppose the plan.  The analogy with a wheel is evident: <SEP> In the 22nd century, Dr Vannevar Morgan is a famous structural engineer who hopes to develop the ""space elevator"" from a theoretical concept to reality and enlists the resources of his employers to carry out experiments.
But the only suitable starting point (Earth station) for the elevator lies at the summit of a mountain in Taprobane occupied by an ancient order of Buddhist monks, who implacably oppose the plan.
Morgan is approached by a Mars-based consortium to develop the elevator on Mars as part of a massive terraforming project.
To demonstrate the viability of the technology, Morgan tries to run a thin cable of ""hyperfilament"" from an orbital factory down to ground level at Taprobane.
A monk at the monastery, a former astrophysicist who is a mathematical genius, tries to sabotage the attempt by creating an artificial hurricane using a hijacked weather-control satellite.
His attempt succeeds, but the hurricane blows butterflies to the peak of the mountain.
This fulfills an ancient prophecy that causes the monks to leave the mountain.
The tower can be built on Earth after all.
Forced to resign his position for acting beyond his authority, Morgan joins the Martian consortium named ""Astroengineering"" and construction of the Tower commences.
Several years later, the Earth-based tower is well under construction and travel up and downâboth for tourists and for transfer to rocket shipsâis being trialled.
An astrophysicist and a group of his students and tower staff are stranded in an emergency chamber six hundred kilometres up after an accident with their transport capsule.
They have limited food and air supplies.
Whilst a laser on a weather-control satellite is able to supply heat, it is imperative to provide them with filter masks against the increasing carbon dioxide and also with food, air, and medical supplies.
Despite his rapidly failing health, Morgan asserts his right to travel up the tower in a one-man ""spider"" to rescue them.
He nearly fails, with limited battery power, but ultimately succeeds in reaching the chamber, delivering the supplies, and thus saving the stranded scientists.

Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing semi-trailer truck. <SEP> Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her paraplegic brother, Franklin (Paul Partain), travel with three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), to visit the grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing.
Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead.
Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family who worked at the old slaughterhouse.
He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it.
When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor.
The group forces him out of the van and drive on.
They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them that the pumps are empty.
They continue toward the homestead, intending to return to the gas station once it has received a fuel delivery.
When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming-hole and the couple head off to find it.
They find the swimming-hole dried up but hear a generator running in the distance.
They stumble upon a nearby house.
Kirk calls out, asking for gas, while Pam waits on a swing in the yard.
After Kirk receives no answer, he enters through the unlocked door, whereupon Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) appears and kills him with a hammer.
Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones.
She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw.
Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset.
He finds the couple's blanket outside the nearby house.
He investigates and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer.
Before he can react, Leatherface kills him and stuffs Pam back into the freezer.
With darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends.
As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw.
Sally runs toward the house and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple in an upstairs room.
She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window and flees to the gas station.
Leatherface disappears into the night.

71,"<BOS> A second device containing explosives was found on a cargo plane in Dubai.  They said that Asiri helped to make the bomb used in the failed Detroit Christmas Day bomb attack and another PETN device used in a failed suicide attack against a top Saudi counter-terrorism official.  Cameron said that authorities had immediately banned packages coming to (or through) the UK from Yemen and would be ""looking extremely carefully at any further steps we have to take"". <SEP> On October 29, 2010, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that a device in a package sent from Yemen and found on a US-bound cargo plane was designed to explode on the aircraft.
Cameron said that investigators were uncertain of when the device, intercepted at East Midlands Airport, was supposed to explode.
A second device containing explosives was found on a cargo plane in Dubai.
In Yemen, police arrested but later released a woman suspected of posting the packages.
The devices, which triggered security alerts in the US, the UK and Middle East, were apparently inserted into printer cartridges and placed in packages addressed to synagogues in the Chicago area.
US President Barack Obama discussed the apparent terrorist plot with Cameron by phone, expressing his ""appreciation for the professionalism of American and British services involved"" in disrupting it.
Cameron said that authorities had immediately banned packages coming to (or through) the UK from Yemen and would be ""looking extremely carefully at any further steps we have to take"".
UK Home Secretary Theresa May said that the government did not believe that the plotters would have known the location of the device when it was planned to explode.
Although details of the device found in Britain were not released, photographs emerged in the US media of an ink-toner cartridge covered in white powder and connected to a circuit board.
The British government's statements suggested that authorities in the UK and the US remained uncertain about the targets and purpose of the apparent plot.
According to Dubai police, the explosives they found were also inside a printer-ink cartridge in a cardboard box with English-language books and souvenirs.
The cartridge contained PETN and plastic explosives mixed with lead azide (an explosive commonly used in detonators).
Unnamed US officials quoted by the Associated Press said that al-Qaeda's explosives expert in Yemen, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, was the likely suspect in the bomb-making.
They said that Asiri helped to make the bomb used in the failed Detroit Christmas Day bomb attack and another PETN device used in a failed suicide attack against a top Saudi counter-terrorism official.
The White House said that Saudi Arabia provided information which helped identify the threat, and the UK's Daily Telegraph reported that an MI6 officer responsible for Yemen had been tipped off. <EOS>","['<BOS> A second device containing explosives was found on a cargo plane in Dubai.

While driving through Sequoyah, Oklahoma, Novalee notices her shoes have fallen through the hole in the floor of the car while she was napping.
She asks Willy Jack to stop at the local Walmart so that she can go to the bathroom and buy new shoes.
When Novalee reaches out for her change at the checkout, the amount of $555 sends her into a panic as we learned early on that she believes that the number 5 is a bad omen.
She runs barefoot outside to discover that Willy Jack has abandoned her and left only her new Polaroid camera behind.
Having no where else to go, she walks back inside and meets Thelma ""Sister"" Husband (Stockard Channing), a woman who runs the Welcome Wagon in town and gives her a buckeye tree.
Novalee also meets a photographer named Moses Whitecotton (Keith David) who advises her to give her baby a strong name.
Later that evening, Novalee feeling sick, runs into the bathroom again to vomit.
When she comes out of the bathroom, she discovers the store has closed.
She soon figures out how to live undetected in the Walmart, spending the days walking around the town and sneaking back into the store to stay the night.
Meanwhile, Willy Jack is arrested and accused of fraternizing with an attractive stranger he has no idea is actually 14 years old and stealing money and cigarettes from a convenience store.
He is sentenced to serve time where he composes a country song entitled ""Beat of the Heart"".
Novalee manages to live at the store for several weeks.
She visits the library and meets Forney Hull (James Frain) who looks after his librarian alcoholic sister Mary Elizabeth (Margaret Hoard).
After finding the info on how to tend to a buckeye tree, Novalee visits Sister Husband where she urges Novalee to plant the buckeye tree in her yard.
Birth contractions wake Novalee during a thunderstorm.
Her water breaks and she goes into labor.
As she collapses, she notices that she is in aisle 5 and because of her superstition, she struggles to pull herself to the next aisle.

yearns to make his mark in show business.
He begins by promoting Eugen Sandow, the ""world's strongest man"", at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, overcoming the competition of rival Billings and his popular attraction, belly dancer Little Egypt, with savvy marketing (allowing women to feel Sandow's muscles).
Ziegfeld returns to his father and young Mary Lou at the Chicago Musical College, and departs to San Francisco, where he and Sandow are deemed frauds for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep as soon as it is let out of the cage.
Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is laughing at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud.
Flo discovers that Billings is on his way to sign a contract with beautiful French star, Anna Held.
Despite losing all his money gambling at Monte Carlo, Flo charms Anna into signing with him instead, pretending that he doesn't know Billings.
Anna twice almost sends him away for his rudeness and for being broke, before revealing that she appreciates his honesty.
Ziegfeld promises to give her ""more publicity than she ever dreams of"" and to feature her alongside America's most prominent theatrical performers.
At first, Anna's performance at the Herald Square Theatre is not a success.
However, Flo manages to generate publicity by sending 20 gallons of milk to Anna every day for a fictitious milk bath beauty treatment, then refusing to pay the bill.
The newspaper stories soon bring the curious to pack his theater, and Ziegfeld introduces eight new performers to back her.
Audience members comment on how the milk must make her skin beautiful and the show is a major success.
Flo sends Anna flowers and jewelry and a note saying ""you were magnificent my wife"", and she agrees to marry him, flaunting her new diamonds to her fellow performers.
However, one success is not enough for the showman.
He has an idea for an entirely new kind of show featuring a bevy of blondes and brunettes, one that will ""glorify"" the American girl.
The new show, the Ziegfeld Follies, an opulent production filled with beautiful women and highly extravagant costumes and sets, is a smash hit, and is followed by more versions of the Follies.

The detachment stages events, often behind enemy lines, that provide alternative explanations for the Allied intelligence successes. <SEP> The action takes place in two periods â World War II and the late 1990s, during the Internet boom and Asian financial crisis.
In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, a young United States Navy code breaker and mathematical genius, is assigned to the newly formed joint British and American Detachment 2702.
This ultra-secret unit's role is to hide the fact that Allied intelligence has cracked the German Enigma code.
The detachment stages events, often behind enemy lines, that provide alternative explanations for the Allied intelligence successes.
United States Marine sergeant Bobby Shaftoe, a veteran of China and Guadalcanal, serves in unit 2702, carrying out Waterhouse's plans.
At the same time, Japanese soldiers, including mining engineer Goto Dengo, an old friend of Shaftoe's, are assigned to build a mysterious bunker in the mountains in the Philippines as part of what turns out to be a literal suicide mission.
Circa 1997, Randy Waterhouse (Lawrence's grandson) joins his old role-playing game companion Avi Halaby in a new startup, providing Pinoy-grams (inexpensive, non-real-time video messages) to migrant Filipinos via new fiber-optic cables.
The Epiphyte Corporation uses this income stream to fund the creation of a data haven in the nearby fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta.
Vietnam veteran Doug Shaftoe, the son of Bobby Shaftoe, and his daughter Amy do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven is overseen by Goto Furudenendu, heir-apparent to Goto Engineering.

In addition, Baslim has Thorby memorize a contingency plan and a message to deliver to one of five starship captains in the event of Baslim's arrest or death.
When Baslim is captured by the local authorities and commits suicide, Thorby and local innkeeper 'Mother Shaum' convey the message to Captain Krausa of the starship Sisu.
Because the 'Free Trader' society to whom Krausa belongs owes a debt to Baslim for the rescue of one of their crews from a slave trader, the captain takes Thorby aboard the Sisu at great risk to himself and his clan.
Thorby is adopted by the captain (thereby gaining considerable shipboard social status) and adjusts to the insular, clannish, matriarchal culture of the traders.
The advanced education provided by Baslim and the fast reflexes of youth make him an ideal fire controlman, in which position Thorby destroys a pirate craft.
His immediate superior, a young woman named Mata, begins to view him as a suitable husbandâsomething forbidden by the Free Trader's customs, and she is transferred to another ship.
Thorby is again transferred when the captain, against the wishes of his wife, the executive officer and head of the clan (who wants to use Thorby's connection to Baslim to enhance Sisu's prestige), obeys Baslim's last wish, entrusting the boy to a military cruiser and asking its captain to assist Thorby in finding his own people.

A mission to Earth is launched, consisting of five Martian males, led by Dop (Tommy Kirk).
Once here their team intends to recruit Earth women to come to Mars in order to mate and produce female offspring, saving their civilization from extinction.
Using their sophisticated transponder, Dop attempts to make contact with the military, who have now tracked the aliens' arrival on Earth.

Fred was a decorated Army Air Forces captain and bombardier in Europe.
Homer lost both hands from burns suffered when his aircraft carrier was sunk, and now uses mechanical hook prostheses.
Al served as an infantry platoon sergeant in the Pacific.
All three have trouble adjusting to civilian life.
Al has a comfortable home and a loving family: wife Milly (Myrna Loy), adult daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, who was only thirteen years Loy's junior), and college freshman son Rob (Michael Hall, who is absent after the first one-third of the film).
He returns to his old job as a bank loan officer.
The bank president views his military experience as valuable in dealing with other returning servicemen.
When Al approves a loan (without collateral) to a young Navy veteran, however, the president advises him against making a habit of it.
Later, at a banquet held in his honor, a slightly inebriated Al expounds his belief that the bank (and America) must stand with the vets who risked everything to defend the country and give them every chance to rebuild their lives.

The textual form of this narrative conceit allowed for much more detail than the typically terse examples of voice acting in Marathon's contemporaries.
Set in 2794, Marathon places the player as a security officer aboard an enormous human starship called theESC.
Marathon, orbiting a colony on the planet Tau Ceti IV.
Throughout the game, the player attempts to defend the ship (and its crew and colonists) from a race of alien slavers called the Pfhor.
As he fights against the invaders, he witnesses interactions among the three shipboard AIs (Leela, Durandal and Tycho), and discovers that all is not as it seems aboard the Marathon.
Among other problems, Durandal has gone rampant and appears to be playing the humans against the Pfhor to further his own mysterious agenda; ultimately leading the S'pht, one of the races enslaved by the Pfhor, in a rebellion.
Seventeen years after the events of the first game, in, the artificial intelligence, Durandal, sends the player and an army of ex-colonists to search the ruins of Lh'owon, the S'pht homeworld.
Lh'owon was once described as a paradise but is now a desert world after first the S'pht Clan Wars and then the invasion by the Pfhor.
He does not mention what information he is looking for, although he does let it slip that the Pfhor are planning to attack Earth, and that being on Lh'owon may stall their advance.
Marathon 2 brings many elements to the game that can be considered staples of the series such as: a Lh'owon-native species known as F'lickta, the mention of an ancient and mysterious race of advanced aliens called the Jjaro, and a clan of S'pht that avoided enslavement by the Pfhor: the S'pht'Kr.

Prior to the tournament he meets Natalia Katkov (Watson) and he falls in love with her almost immediately.
She in turn finds his manner to be appealing and they begin to see each other in spite of her mother's disapproval.
Competing alongside Luzhin in the championship is Dottore Salvatore Turati (Fabio Sartor), who is approached by Leo Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), a Russian, who is Luzhin's former chess tutor from pre-revolutionary Russia.
Valentinov tells the Italian that Luzhin cannot handle pressure and he intimates he will make sure that his former prodigy will be unsettled off-table giving Turati a winning chance.
The competition starts badly for Luzhin who is unsettled by the presence of his former friend and coach.
He struggles through the early rounds but he soon begins to win again as his relationship with Katkov becomes closer and intimate.
She then informs her parents that she is going to marry him.
Meanwhile, Luzhin goes on to reach the final and face Turati.
But in the finals the Russian ÃmigrÃ© loses out to the time clock, forcing the game to adjourn.
However, outside the venue, he is whisked away by an accomplice of Valentinov who abandons him in the countryside.
His former teacher knows that this will completely unhinge him because of the memory of his parents' abandonment many years ago.
Luzhin wanders aimlessly until he collapses and is found by a group of Blackshirts.
Luzhin is taken to the hospital suffering from complete mental exhaustion.
The doctor informs Katkov that he will die if he keeps playing chess as he is addicted to the game and it's consuming his very being.
Nevertheless, even while recuperating Valentinov comes around with a chess board encouraging Luzhin to finish the match with the Italian, Turati.

Harriman, ""the last of the Robber Barons"", is obsessed with being the first to travel to&mdash;and possess&mdash;the moon.
He asks his business partner, George Strong, and other tycoons to invest in the venture.
Most dismiss Harriman's plans as foolhardy: Nuclear rocket fuel is scarce as the space station that produces it blew up, also destroying the only existing spaceship.
The necessary technology for a chemical-fueled rocket stretches the boundaries of current engineering.
The endeavor is both incredibly costly and of uncertain profitability.
One skeptic offers to sell ""all of my interest in the Moon.
for fifty cents""; Harriman accepts and tries to buy the other associates' interests as well.
Strong and two others agree to back his plans.
The technical problems are solvable with money and talent.
To solve the tougher financial problems, Harriman exploits commercial and political rivalries.
He implies to the Moka-Coka company, for example, that rival soft drink maker 6+ plans to turn the Moon into a massive billboard, using a rocket to scatter black dust on the surface in patterns.

Harriman seeks to avoid government ownership of the Moon.

On that basis, Mexico, Central and parts of South America, and other countries in those latitudes around the world, have a claim on the Moon.
The United States also has a claim due to Florida and Texas.

The play opens with Hermia, who is in love with Lysander, resistant to her father Egeus' demand that she wed Demetrius, whom he has arranged for her to marry.
Helena meanwhile pines unrequitedly for Demetrius.
Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian law before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or else face death.
Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong chastity while worshipping the goddess Artemis as a nun.
Peter Quince and his fellow players Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Robin Starveling, Tom Snout, and Snug plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, ""the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe"".
Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them to the players.
Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time.
He would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles.
Bottom is told by Quince that he would do the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and ladies enough for the Duke and Lords to have the players hanged.
Quince ends the meeting with ""at the Duke's oak we meet"".
In a parallel plot line, Oberon, king of the fairies, and Titania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens.
Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding.
Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his ""knight"" or ""henchman"", since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers.
Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience.

One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).
One day, Senex and Domina go on a trip and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero.
Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin).
Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom.
Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior Miles Gloriosus, who is expected to claim her very soon.
Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a plague from Crete, which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages.
By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love.
But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for ""that is the way of a courtesan"".
To appease her, he tells her to wait (""that's what virgins do best, isn't it.
"") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives.
Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious.
He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body.

Between fights, he works as an enforcer for loan shark Tony Gazzo.
The World Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed, announces plans to hold a match in Philadelphia during the upcoming United States Bicentennial.
However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent, Mac Lee Greene, is unable to compete due to an injured hand.
With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to face him.
He finds Balboa while searching through books of fighters, liking his nickname ""The Italian Stallion"" and his fighting style, being Southpaw.
Rocky meets with promoter Miles Jergens, presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners.
Rocky reluctantly agrees to the match, which will pay him $150,000.
After several weeks of training, using whatever he can find, including meat carcasses as punching bags, Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from former boxer Mickey ""Mighty Mick"" Goldmill, a respected trainer and former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s, who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential.
At the same time, Rocky begins a relationship with Adrian, a clerk at the local pet store.
He gradually gains the shy Adrian's trust, culminating in a kiss.
Her alcoholic brother Paulie becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his meatpacking business at the fight.
The night before the match, Rocky becomes depressed after touring the arena.
He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win, but is content to go the distance against Creed and prove himself to everyone.
On New Year's Day, the climactic boxing match begins, with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as George Washington and then Uncle Sam.
Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first roundâthe first time that Creed has ever been knocked down.

Eight nonsense words from ""Jabberwocky"" appear in The Hunting of the Snark: bandersnatch, beamish, frumious, galumphing, jubjub, mimsiest (which previously appeared as mimsy in ""Jabberwocky""), outgrabe and uffish.
In a letter to the mother of his young friend Gertrude Chataway, Carroll described the domain of the Snark as ""an island frequented by the Jubjub and the Bandersnatchâno doubt the very island where the Jabberwock was slain"".
The crew consists of ten members, whose descriptions all begin with the letter B: a Bellman, the leader; a ""Boots"", who is the only member of the crew without an illustration; a maker of Bonnets and Hoods; a Barrister, who settles arguments among the crew; a Broker, who can appraise the goods of the crew; a Billiard-marker, who is greatly skilled; a Banker, who possesses all of the crew's money; a Butcher, who can only kill beavers; a Beaver, who makes lace and has saved the crew from disaster several times; and a Baker, who can only bake wedding cake, forgets his belongings and his name, but possesses courage.
After crossing the sea guided by the Bellman's map of the Oceanâa blank sheet of paperâthe hunting party arrive in a strange land, and the Bellman informs them of the five signs of a Snark: its ""meagre and hollow, but crisp"" taste; a habit of rising late and taking breakfast during five o'clock tea; ""its slowness in taking a jest""; a ""fondness for bathing-machines""; and its ambition.
The Bellman warns them that some Snarks are highly dangerous Boojums, causing the Baker to faint.

In addition to Forsaken and Darkfriends (the antagonist's known subordinates), the meeting includes two Aes Sedai, one later identified as Liandrin.
At Fal Dara in Shienar, following the events in The Eye of the World, the protagonists are visited by the Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, who identifies Rand al'Thor as the Dragon Reborn.
Mat's condition worsens through his psychic attachment to a parasitic dagger.
Lan Mandragoran instructs Rand in sword fighting.
Darkfriend Padan Fain is imprisoned but subsequently freed by Darkforces, stealing the Horn of Valere and the tainted dagger.

Nynaeve al'Meara and Egwene al'Vere accompany Moraine to Tar Valon for Aes Sedai training, where they befriend Elayne Trakand and the clairvoyant Min.
There, Nynaeve passes the test to become Accepted, a rank in the White Tower below Aes Sedai and above a Novice.
Rand, Loial, and Hurin are separated from the Shienaran party and transported to an alternate world; similar to their own, but deserted and distorted.
Rand suspects that he activated the portal stone by unconsciously channeling saidin in his sleep, although Egwene dreams that a mysterious woman (later identified as Lanfear) is responsible.
Rand's struggle to accept his channeling ability is a recurring element in the novel.
In this alternate world, Rand meets Ba'alzamon and has a heron's image (the crest of his sword) branded into his palm in a fight.
Later, with the help of Selene (Lanfear in disguise), they return to their own world, ahead of Fain's and Ingtar's groups.
This done, they recover the Horn and dagger.
At a loss to explain Rand's disappearance, Lord Ingtar's group pursue Padan Fain with the aid of Perrin, who uses a telepathic ability to communicate with wolves.

The commandant, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon.
The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), informs Saito that the Geneva Conventions exempt officers from manual labor.
At the following morning's assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men are sent off to work.
Saito slaps him across the face with his copy of the conventions and threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down.
When Major Clipton (James Donald), the British medical officer, intervenes, telling Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murdering the officers, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense tropical heat.
That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box.
Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape.
Two are shot dead, but United States Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), gets away, although badly wounded.
He stumbles into a village of natives who help him leave by boat.
Nicholson refuses to compromise.
Meanwhile, the prisoners are working as little as possible and sabotaging whatever they can.
Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit ritual suicide.
Desperate, Saito uses the anniversary of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers from manual labor.
Nicholson conducts an inspection and is shocked by the poor job being done by his men.
Over the protests of some of his officers, he allows Captain Reeves (Peter Williams) and Major Hughes (John Boxer) to design and build a proper bridge, despite its military value to the Japanese, for the sake of maintaining his men's morale.
The Japanese engineers had chosen a poor site, so the original construction is abandoned and a new bridge is begun downstream.
Shears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon with a beautiful nurse (Ann Sears), when British Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) informs him that theS.
Navy has transferred him over to the British to join a commando mission to destroy the bridge before it's completed.
Shears is appalled at the idea of returning to a place from which he nearly died during escape.

Milly teaches Adam's rowdy, ill-behaved younger brothers manners and social mores.  A free-for-all ensues in which the brothers dominate their physically weaker townie rivals. <SEP> In 1850, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee comes into a town in the Oregon Territory to search for a bride.
Met with ridicule by some locals, he comes upon the local tavern where he meets Milly.
Convinced of her worth by the quality of her cooking and her insistence on finishing her chores before she would leave with him, he proposes and she accepts despite knowing each other for only a few hours.
On the journey home Milly talks about how she is excited to be cooking and taking care of only one man, visibly upsetting Adam.
When they arrive at his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is one of seven brothers living under the same roof.
The brothers have been named alphabetically from the Old Testament in order of birth: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for frankincense, the Old Testament having no names beginning with F), and Gideon.
All of the brothers have red hair and all but Gideon are well over six feet tall.
Milly teaches Adam's rowdy, ill-behaved younger brothers manners and social mores.
She also shows them how to dance.
At first, the brothers have a hard time changing from their ""mountain man"" ways, but eventually each comes to see that the only way he will get a woman of his own is to do things Milly's way.
They try out their new manners at a barn-raising, where they meet six women they like â Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice.
The girls take a fancy to the brothers as well.
However, they already have suitors among the young men of the town, who jealously taunt the brothers into fighting during the barn-raising.
At first the six brothers remember Milly's teaching and try to resist being drawn into a fight by accepting physical indignities.
Adam refuses to let himself be pushed around by the rival suitors and calls his younger brothers cowards for letting them get away with their behavior.
The girls' suitors from the town finally go too far when they attack Adam, provoking Gideon into fighting back.
A free-for-all ensues in which the brothers dominate their physically weaker townie rivals.
Although the Pontipees did not start the fight, they are banished from the town after demolishing the barn they were raising in the course of the brawl.

After a quick chase to a parade float storage yard, Buffy finally confronts Lothos, shortly after she and Pike take down his gang. <SEP> High school senior Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) is introduced as a stereotypical, shallow cheerleader at Hemery High School in Los Angeles.
She is a carefree popular girl whose main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey.
While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland).
He informs her that she is The Slayer, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her.
She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail.
In addition, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature, indifference to slaying and sharp-tongued remarks.
After several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos (Rutger Hauer), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn (Paul Reubens).
Two young men, Oliver Pike (Luke Perry), and best friend Benny (David Arquette), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they are attacked by Amilyn.
Benny is turned but Pike is saved by Merrick.
As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him.
Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him.
Not only this, but a studious girl from Buffy's class, Cassandra, is abducted one night by Amilyn and sacrificed to Lothos.
When her body is found, the news spreads through LA and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique.
When Pike realizes there is something wrong with Benny and that he is no longer safe, he decides to leave town.
His plan is thwarted, however, when he encounters Amilyn and his tribe of vampires.
Amilyn hitches a ride on the hood of his van which crashes into a tree just before Amilyn loses an arm.

93,"<BOS> The villagers force Howie inside a giant wicker man statue, set it ablaze and surround it, singing the Middle English folk song ""Sumer Is Icumen In"".  Lord Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in Scotland's climate, and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island. <SEP> Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) journeys to the remote Hebridean island Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison (Gerry Cowper), about whom he has received an anonymous letter.
Howie, a devout Christian, is disturbed to find the islanders paying homage to the pagan Celtic gods of their ancestors.
They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the May Day celebrations, teach children of the phallic association of the maypole, and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats.
The Islanders, including Rowan's mother (Irene Sunters), appear to be attempting to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed.
While staying at the Green Man Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the May Queen.
The photograph of the most recent celebration is suspiciously missing; the landlord (Lindsay Kemp) tells him it was broken.
The landlord's beautiful daughter, Willow (Britt Ekland), attempts to seduce Howie, but he refuses her advances.
After seeing Rowan's burial plot, Howie meets the island's leader, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), grandson of a Victorian agronomist, to obtain permission for an exhumation.
Lord Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in Scotland's climate, and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island.
Over the next several generations, the island's inhabitants fully embraced the pagan religion.
Howie finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes.
His research reveals that when there is a poor harvest, the islanders make a human sacrifice to ensure that the next will be bountiful.
He comes to the conclusion that Rowan is alive and has been chosen for sacrifice.
During the May Day celebration, Howie knocks out and ties up the innkeeper so he can steal his costume and mask (that of Punch, the fool) and infiltrate the parade.
When it seems the villagers are about to sacrifice Rowan, he cuts her free and flees with her into a cave.
On exiting it, they are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns.
Lord Summerisle tells Howie that Rowan is not the intended sacrifice &mdash; Howie himself is.

The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but its corruption curses his arm in the battle.
The curse gives him superhuman strength in the injured arm, but is fatal.
The villagers discover that the demon was once a boar god, Nago, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body.
The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands Nago came from.
Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jiko-bÅ, a wandering monk, who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a Kirin-like creature by day and a giant ""nightwalker"" by night.
Nearby, men herd oxen to Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi, when they are attacked by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro.
Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl.
Later, Ashitaka discovers two injured Irontown men, and sees San and her wolf pack; he greets them, but they leave.
He carries the injured men through the forest, where he encounters many kodama, and glimpses the Forest Spirit.
In Irontown, Ashitaka learns Eboshi has built the town by clear-cutting forests to claim ironsand and produce iron, leading to conflict with the forest gods.
The town is a refuge for social outcasts, including former brothel workers and lepers, whom Eboshi employs to manufacture firearms to defend against the gods; Nago was turned into a demon by one of Eboshi's guns.
Eboshi also explains that San, self-dubbed Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves as one of their own and resents humankind.
San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, knocking them both unconscious.
As he leaves, he is fatally shot by a villager, but the curse allows him to continue carrying San and only collapse much later.
San awakens and almost kills the dying Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful.
She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit saves his life.

Polenin and Vostrikov are informed that once the nuclear reactor reaches 1000&nbsp;Â°C, the nuclear reactor will explode. <SEP> In 1961, the Soviet Union launches its first ballistic missile nuclear submarine, the K-19.
Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), aided by executive officer Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson).
Polenin, the original captain, and the crew have served together for some time, but Vostrikov's appointment is alleged to have been aided by his wife's political connections.
During his first inspection, Vostrikov discovers the reactor officer to be drunk and asleep on duty and sacks him, ordering Polenin to request a replacement.
The new reactor officer, Vadim Radtchenko (Peter Sarsgaard), arrives direct from nuclear school, fresh from the naval academy.
Before the launch, the medical officer is killed when struck by an oncoming truck, and is replaced by the command's foremost medical officer, an army officer, never having been out to sea and prone to motion sickness.
During the official launch of the K-19, the bottle of champagne fails to break when it strikes the bow, known to be a sign of ill fortune.
The crew's performance improves and their first mission starts.
The K-19 is to surface in the Arctic to fire an unarmed ballistic missile as a test, then to patrol a zone in the Atlantic within range of New York City and WashingtonC.
To test the submarine's limits, Vostrikov orders the K-19 to submerge past its maximum operational depth of 250 meters to its ""crush depth"" (300 meters), then surface rapidly at full-speed to break through the Arctic pack-ice, estimated at no more than one metre thick.
Polenin regards this maneuver as dangerous and storms off the bridge.
Scraping along the underside of the ice, the K-19 breaks through with no apparent damage.
The test missile is launched successfully.
On the second part of its mission, a pipe carrying coolant to the reactor cooling system springs a leak and then bursts completely.
Polenin and Vostrikov are informed that once the nuclear reactor reaches 1000&nbsp;Â°C, the nuclear reactor will explode.
Control rods are inserted to stop the reactor, but without coolant the reactor temperature continues to rise rapidly.
Polenin and Radtchenko learn back-up coolant systems are not installed.

A containment wall surrounds the island and routes out of Manhattan have been dismantled or mined, while armed helicopters patrol the rivers.
In 1997, while travelling to a peace summit between the United States, China and the Soviet Union, Air Force One is hijacked by a domestic terrorist posing as a stewardess.
The President is given a tracking bracelet and his briefcase (containing an audiotape describing a powerful new bomb) handcuffed to his wrist.
He makes it to an escape pod, and lands in Manhattan just before Air Force One crashes, killing everyone else aboard.
Police are dispatched to rescue the President.
However, Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the top crime boss in the prison, warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage, and that he will be killed if any further rescue attempts are mounted.
Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to ""Snake"" Plissken, a former Special Forces soldier convicted of attempting to rob the Federal Reserve in Denver: if Snake rescues the President and retrieves the cassette tape, Hauk will arrange a presidential pardon.
To ensure his compliance, Hauk injects him with micro-explosives that will rupture Snake's carotid arteries within 22 hours; if Snake returns with the President and the tape in time, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.
Snake is sent into Manhattan in a stealth glider, landing atop the World Trade Center.
He tracks the President's life-monitor bracelet to a vaudeville theatre, only to find it on the wrist of an insane old man.
He meets ""Cabbie,"" who takes Snake in his armored taxi cab to Harold ""Brain"" Hellman, an advisor to the Duke based in the New York Public Library, and a former associate of Snake's.
Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to unify the gangs in a mass exodus across the heavily-guarded Queensboro Bridge, using the President as a human shield and a map Brain has created to avoid the land mines planted on all the remaining bridges.
Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's compound at Grand Central Station.

In Diablo, an unnamed warrior defeated Diablo and attempted to contain the Lord of Terror's essence within his own body.
Since then, the hero has become corrupted by the demon's spirit, causing demons to enter the world around him and wreak havoc.
A band of adventurers who pass through the Rogue Encampment hear these stories of destruction and attempt to find out the cause of the evil, starting with this corrupted ""Dark Wanderer"".
As the story develops, the truth behind this corruption is revealed: the soulstones were originally designed to capture the Prime Evils who were banished to the mortal realm after being overthrown by the Lesser Evils.
With the corruption of Diablo's soulstone, the demon is able to control the Dark Wanderer.
The soulstone of another demon, Baal, was united with the mage Tal-Rasha, who volunteered to absorb Baal's spirit in his own body and be imprisoned in a tomb.
