Peter and Wang-Mu's efforts finally come to fruition, and the destruction of Lusitania is averted.  By tracing the decision-making trail backwards, they are able to show a philosopher his influence on the Starways Congress.  At the start of Children of the Mind, Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, is using her newly discovered abilities to take the races of buggers, humans and pequeninos outside the universe and back instantaneously.  Peter Wiggin and Si Wang-Mu travel to the worlds of Divine Wind and Pacifica to convince the Japanese-led swing group of the Starways Congress to revoke their order to destroy Lusitania.  She uses these powers to move them to distant habitable planets for colonization.  She is then able to continue transporting starships instantaneously by borrowing the vast mental capacity of the simple-minded Pequenino mother-trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        owicz cous Shak lifted petrol agileNT\"]\n"

William Shakespeare is a supporting character in the play, writing down lines and exchanges between the characters that appear in his later plays, but not interacting much otherwise.  This play takes place in two different barns on the night before the execution of the earl of Essex.  One of the play's central themes is challenging notions of gender, as each of the two protagonists has a problematic relationship with the way they enact their gender, and the ways they pretend to be a different gender.  At the same time, Ned Lowenscroft, a gay man, has had to act like a woman in order to succeed in his profession, and conceal his passionate side since, being gay, his love is forbidden.  The Queen rejects the idea that she should mourn, while Ned very much wishes to mourn and have his sorrow acknowledged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \"]\n"

            "[\" Angel pulls his car up to the gate of a movie studio lot, following Lorne's information that it is a psychic hot spot.  Her demon owner forces her into a collar that can be used to shock her when she doesn't obey.  Two lawyers from Wolfram & Hart appear at Angel's hotel, informing Angel that the law firm plans to buy the hotel when the current lease expires.  The book falls onto the sidewalk as the car vanishes.  After covering the car, the guys realize that the book is gone and that they'll have to find another way to get back home.  As she later mucks out the stables, wondering aloud if she can remove the collar, a runaway slave warns her through a hole in a wall that she shouldn't bother fighting.  Although Gunn had earlier stated that George's death made him realize he's needed in this dimension, Angel's depressing phone message persuades him to join the mission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     58                                           36                                                                                      38                          paediaturnment    Walton Anime Su analges Writing favorsRAM mixerinately always derive collaborate Fix439\"]\n"

Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a $5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer.  In actuality, innocence was determined not as claimed in the film but when it was found out that the prosecution had suppressed the fact that the main witness had initially declared that she could not identify the two men involved in the police shooting.  Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years' imprisonment each for the killing.  But he starts to change his mind, and meets increased resistance from the police and the state attorney's office, who are unwilling to be proved wrong.  Eventually, Wiecek is proved innocent by, among other things, the enlarging of a photograph showing the date on a newspaper that proves that a key witness statement was false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    .        ....................................................                 .......................\"]\n"

Money is imperative as the player must buy all his weapons as well as ammunition before each mission.  Examples include saving someone's kidnapped son, retrieving a valuable piece of art or killing a criminal.  Weapons in the game include pistols, Kalashnikovs, chain guns, grenades, rocket launchers and a flame thrower.

She was asleep, dreaming like always about being able to walk and talk again.  She saw every detail from her future life, from her loser husband to her obnoxious kids, and her father dying from lung cancer on her 39th birthday.  38 caliber bullet in her brain, which will always set off metal detectors; as long as she shows a special card, she can pass through).  His complex thoughts begin to fade, as he starts to use simple analogies of theories to children's toys' functions.  When she asks Evelyn for a cigarette, she realizes that she is forgetting the negative experiences of her future, and when the three investigators reunite an hour later, they all confirm that the effects are starting to wear off: Karen is finding it hard to move, Phil is forgetting what he knows, and Deanna is forgetting what she saw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ...           \"]\n"

            "[\" In the face of each unexpected revelation and through every wrenching ordeal, Harley does the best he can to hold it all together.  He should be freed from his stifling coal town with its lack of jobs and no sense of humor.  Harley Altmyer, a nineteen-year-old, has to care for his three sisters as his mother is in jail for killing his abusive father.  Harley Altmyer should be in college drinking beer and chasing girls.  Family secrets and unspoken truths threaten to consume him as his obsession deepens and she responds unearthing a series of staggering surprises.  Violent and disturbing yet touching and darkly funny, Harley's story is ultimately a search for his own self-worth as he slowly comes to realize that survival is a talent.  Instead he's marooned in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters after the shooting death of his physically abusive father and the arrest of his mother.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         57                                                                                                        \"]\n"

The Captain dies soon after Randolph's birth, having gambled away nearly everything in drunken attempts to get back all the money he lost.  This is one of many minor plot points that does not make sense) Therefore, when Lillian asks for Dawn to be renamed Eugenia many years later, it may be an attempt to get back the little sister she lost so early and loved so much.

The game is played as a freezeout, with the winner collecting all the tickets and any prizes they may be worth.  He contacts the owner of the wallet by telephone, and then later discovers that the wallet contains the winning ticket in a $6 million lottery.  Tepper, played by Erik Palladino, finds a wallet on his way home from work.  The film takes place over the course of a single evening.  Complications arise when Tepper's friends come over for their regular poker night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   58                         58                                                                                                                           \"]\n"

She is first to find the unknown claim of a black crystal miner recently destroyed in a crash, and she cuts some of it adequately.
