the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer\\'s death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer\\'s ways.\\nHowever, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves.\\n(In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into animal glue) Years pass, and the windmill is rebuilt along with construction of another windmill, which makes the farm a good amount of income.\\nHowever, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating and running water are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives.\\nIn addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the Revolution are dead, as is Farmer Jones, who died in another part of England.\\nThe pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes.\\nThe Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: \"All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others\".\\nNapoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance.\\nHe abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name \"The Manor Farm\".\\nAs the animals look from pigs to humans, they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two.\\n',\n",
              " 1: 'Alex is a 15-year-old living in near-future dystopian England who leads his gang on a night of opportunistic, random \"ultra-violence\".\\nAlex\\'s friends (\"droogs\" in the novel\\'s Anglo-Russian slang, \\'Nadsat\\') are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser who is the gang\\'s muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence.\\nCharacterised as a sociopath and a hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex also displays intelligence, quick wit, and a predilection for classical music; he is particularly fond of Beethoven, referred to as \"Lovely Ludwig Van\".\\nThe novella begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, the Korova Milk Bar, and drinking \"milk-plus\"â\\x80\\x94a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer\\'s drug of choiceâ\\x80\\x94to prepare for a night of mayhem.\\nThey assault a scholar walking home from the public library;

the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare\\'s sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door.\\nPhilia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him.\\nSurprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does.\\nHysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired.\\nPseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare\\'s sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath.\\nTaking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius.\\nBut while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children.\\nHysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted â\\x80\\x93 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath.\\nErronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex\\'s house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain\\'s wrath.\\nPseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her.\\nDispleased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome\\'s winding streets.\\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low\".\\nShe disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia\\'s) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful.\\nPseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in drag and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague.\\nUnfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague.\\nWith the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia â\\x80\\x93 all wearing identical white robes and veils).\\nMeanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"\\'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his eunuchs out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\\nFinally, the Captain\\'s troops are able to round everyone up.\\nHis plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble â\\x80\\x93 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children.\\nPhilia\\'s betrothal to the Captain is obviously nullified by the unexpected revelation that he\\'s her brother.\\nPhilia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children.\\nA happy ending prevails for all â\\x80\\x93 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\\n',\n",

son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to despise Barry, calling him a \\'common opportunist\\' who does not truly love his mother.\\nBarry retaliates by subjecting Bullingdon to systematic physical abuse.\\nThe Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife\\'s money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.\\nSome years later, Barry\\'s mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate.\\nShe warns her son that if Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry and his son Bryan penniless.\\nBarry\\'s mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself.\\nTo further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society.\\nAll this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon.\\nA now young adult Lord Bullingdon crashes the event where he publicly enumerates the reasons that he detests his stepfather so dearly, declaring it his intent to leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother.\\nSeething with hatred, Barry savagely assaults Bullingdon until he is pulled off by the guests.\\nThis loses Barry all the wealthy and powerful friends he has worked so hard to entreat and he is cast out of polite society.\\nNevertheless, Bullingdon makes good on his word by leaving the estate and England itself for parts unknown.\\nIn contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves an overindulgent and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon\\'s departure.\\nHe cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan\\'s insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday.\\nThe spoiled Bryan disobeys his parents\\' direct instructions that Bryan ride the horse only in the presence of his father, is thrown by the horse, is paralyzed, and dies a few days later from his injuries.\\nThe grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan.\\nLeft in charge of the families\\' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry\\'s mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry\\'s spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon\\'s condition.\\nPlunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself ill).\\nThe Reverend and the family\\'s accountant Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon.\\nUpon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen\\'s club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon.\\nBullingdon demands satisfaction for Barry\\'s public assault, challenging him to a duel.\\nThe duel with pistols is held in a tithe barn.\\nA coin-toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot.\\nBarry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously fires into the ground, but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received \"satisfaction\".\\nIn the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg.\\nAt a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.\\nWhile Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate.\\nA few days later, Bullington sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Lord Bullingdon will grant Barry an annuity of five hundred guineas a year on the condition that he leave England, with payments ending the moment should Barry ever return.\\nOtherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry\\'s creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed.\\nDefeated in mind and body, Barry accepts.\\nThe narrator states that Barry went first back to Ireland with his mother, then to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success).\\nBarry kept his word and never returned to England or ever saw Lady Lyndon again.\\nThe final scene (set in December 1789) shows a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry\\'s annuity cheque as her son looks on.\\n',\n",

station, Babylon 4, vanished without a trace twenty-four hours after it became fully operational.\\nThe television series takes its name from the Babylon 5 space station, located in the Epsilon Eridani star system, at the fifth Lagrangian point between the fictional planet Epsilon III and its moon.\\nBabylon 5 is an O\\'Neill cylinder five miles long and a half-mile to a mile in diameter.\\nLiving areas accommodate the various alien species, providing differing atmospheres and gravities.\\nHuman visitors to the alien sectors are shown using breathing equipment and other measures to tolerate the conditions.\\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258â\\x80\\x932262.\\nEach season shares its name with an episode

with the much more powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race during the Battle of the Line.\\nDuring 2258, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station.\\nMuch of the story revolves around his gradual discovery that it was his capture by the Minbari at the Battle of the Line which ended the war against Earth.\\nUpon capturing Sinclair, the Minbari came to believe that he was the reincarnation of Valen, a great Minbari leader and hero of the last Minbari-Shadow war.\\nInferring that others of their species had been and were continuing to be reborn as humans, and in obedience to the edict that Minbari do not kill one another lest they harm the soul, they stopped the war just as Earth\\'s final defenses were on the verge of collapse.\\nMeanwhile, tensions between the Centauri Republic, which is an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former dominion which rebelled and gained freedom, are increasing.\\nAmbassador G\\'Kar of the Narn wishes for his people to strike back at the Centauri for what they did, and Ambassador Londo Mollari of the Centauri wishes for his people to become again the great empire they once were.\\nAs part of these struggles, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally to strike back at the Narn, further heightening tensions.\\nIt is gradually revealed that Ambassador Delenn is a member of the mysterious and powerful Grey Council, the ruling body of the Minbari.\\nTowards the end of 2258, she begins the transformation into a Minbari-human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari.\\nThe year ends with the death of Earth Alliance president Luis Santiago.\\nThe death is officially ruled an accident, but some members of the military, including the staff of Babylon 5, believe it to be an assassination.\\nAt the beginning of 2259, Captain John Sheridan replaces Sinclair as the military governor of the station after Sinclair is reassigned as ambassador to Minbar.\\nHe and the command staff gradually learn that the assassination of President Santiago was arranged by his then-Vice President, Morgan Clark, who has now become president.\\nConflict develops between the Babylon 5 command staff and the Psi Corps, an increasingly autocratic organization which oversees and controls the lives of human telepaths.\\nThe Shadows, an ancient and extremely powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are revealed to be the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258.\\nCentauri Ambassador Londo Mollari unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with their mysterious human representative mr Morden in the ongoing conflict with the Narn.\\nThe elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, unfortunately has insufficient control to prevent others from instigating war against the Narn Regime.\\nWhen the emperor dies suddenly during a peace mission to Babylon 5, a number of conspirators, including Ambassador Londo Mollari and Lord Refa, take control of the Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor\\'s unstable nephew on the throne.\\nTheir first act is to start open aggression against the Narn.\\nAfter a full-scale war breaks out, the Centauri with the help of the Shadows through Londo eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving mass drivers, outlawed weapons of mass destruction.\\nTowards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting freedom of speech.\\nThe Vorlons are revealed to be the

the moons of Jupiter, their ship is seen by the Earth Alliance destroyer Agamemnon, but not recognized.\\nThough they escape and no shots were fired in the encounter, President Clark uses it as an excuse to declare martial law.\\nThis triggers a war of independence on Mars, which had long had a strained political relationship with Earth.\\nBabylon 5 attempts to avoid conflict with Earth, but in response to civilian bombings on Mars, concerns with Night Watch, and illegal orders meant to oppress their populations, they choose to declare independence from Earth, along with several other outlying Earth Alliance colonies including Orion VII and Proxima III.\\nIn response, the Earth Alliance attempts to retake Babylon 5 by force, but with the aid of the Minbari, who have allied with the station against the growing Shadow threat, the attack is repelled at great cost.\\nBecoming concerned over the Shadows\\' growing influence among his people, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari attempts to sever ties with them.\\nmr Morden, the Shadows\\' human representative, tricks him into restoring the partnership by engineering the murder of Mollari\\'s mistress while putting the blame on a rival Centauri House.\\nOpen warfare breaks out between the Shadows and the alliance led by Babylon 5 and the Minbari.\\nIt is learned that genetic manipulation by the Vorlons is the source of telepathy in humans and other races, as it is later discovered that Shadow ships are vulnerable to telepathic attacks.\\nDispleased at the Vorlons\\' lack of direct action against the Shadows, Captain John Sheridan browbeats Vorlon ambassador Kosh Naranek into launching an attack against their mutual enemy.\\nKosh\\'s deeds lead to his subsequent assassination by the Shadows.\\nFormer station commander Jeffrey Sinclair returns to Babylon 5 to enlist the aid of Captain Sheridan, Delenn, Ivanova and Marcus in stealing the Babylon 4 space station and sending it 1,000 years back in time to use it as a base of operations against the Shadows in the previous Minbari-Shadow war.\\nHaving undergone a similar transformation to the one Delenn had at the end of Season 1, Sinclair transforms into a Minbari and is subsequently revealed to be the actual Valen of Minbari legend, rather than simply a reincarnation.\\nMeanwhile, as a result of the unstable time travel, Sheridan sees a vision of the downfall of Centauri Prime when it is attacked by Shadow allies after the Shadow war, and he becomes determined to prevent that future.\\nSheridan and Delenn begin a romantic relationship, but their lives and the war are interrupted by the sudden reappearance of Sheridan\\'s wife, who was presumed dead after taking part in an archaeological expedition to Z\\'ha\\'dum years prior.\\nShe tells Sheridan that the Shadows are not evil, hoping to bring him back with her and recruit him to their cause.\\nHe soon realizes that her mind has been tampered with and corrupted by the Shadows, but accepts her offer to visit Z\\'ha\\'dum because he hopes it will save the galaxy sooner and prevent the downfall of Centauri Prime.\\nHe takes with him a pair of nuclear warheads, which he uses to destroy their largest city, and is last seen jumping into a miles-deep pit to escape the explosion.\\nShadow vessels appear at the station, but disappear after Sheridan\\'s attack.\\nHowever, after they leave, station personnel realize that Garibaldi, who left in a fighter to defend against the vessels, never returned.\\nIn 2261, the Vorlons join the Shadow War, but their tactics become a concern for the alliance when the Vorlons begin destroying entire planets which they deem to have been \"influenced\" by the Shadows.\\nDisturbed by this turn of events, Babylon 5 recruits several other powerful and ancient races (the First Ones) to their cause, against both the Shadows and the Vorlons.\\nCaptain John Sheridan returns to the station after escaping from Z\\'ha\\'dum and reunites the galaxy against the Shadows, but at a price: barring illness or injury, he has only 20 years left to live.\\nHe is accompanied by a mysterious alien named Lorien who claims to be the first sentient being in the galaxy, and who breathed life into Sheridan at Z\\'ha\\'dum.\\nOnce Sheridan returns, he and Delenn formalize their relationship and begin planning to marry, although most of their plans are put on hold due to the ongoing war.\\nHours before Sheridan\\'s return, Garibaldi is rescued and returned to the station, in rather dubious circumstances.\\nOver the course of the next several months, he becomes markedly more paranoid and suspicious of other alien races and of Sheridan than he was before, causing worry among his friends and colleagues.\\nCentauri Emperor Cartagia forges a relationship with the Shadows.\\nWith the reluctant help of his enemy G\\'Kar, Londo Mollari engineers the assassination of Cartagia and repudiates his agreement with the Shadows.\\nIn exchange for G\\'Kar\\'s help, Londo frees the Narn from Centauri occupation.\\nLondo afterwards kills mr Morden and destroys the Shadow vessels based on the Centauri homeworld, in a successful attempt to save his planet from destruction by the Vorlons.\\nAided by the other ancient races, and several younger ones, Sheridan lures both the Vorlons and the Shadows into an immense battle, during which the Vorlons and Shadows reveal that they have been left as guardians of the younger races, but due to philosophical differences, ended up using them as pawns in their endless proxy wars throughout the ages.\\nThe younger races reject their continued interference, and the Vorlons and Shadows, along with the remaining First Ones, agree to depart the galaxy in order to allow the younger races to find their own way.\\nAfter the Shadows are defeated, Garibaldi leaves his post as security chief and works on his own as a \"provider of information\".\\nHe begins working for one William Edgars, a Mars tycoon, who is married to Garibaldi\\'s former love.\\nWhile he works ever closer with Edgars, he becomes increasingly aggressive toward Sheridan and eventually leaves Babylon 5.\\nMinbar is gripped by a brief civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes.\\nDelenn secretly meets with Neroon of the Warrior caste and convinces him that neither side can be allowed to win.\\nShe tells him that she will undergo a ritual wherein she will be willing to sacrifice herself, but will stop the ritual before she actually dies.\\nWhen Neroon sees that she actually intends to go through the entire ritual, he rescues her and sacrifices himself instead, declaring that, although he was born Warrior caste, in his heart he is Religious caste.\\nAs part of the ongoing conflict between Earth and Babylon 5, Garibaldi eventually betrays Sheridan and arranges his capture in order to gain Edgars\\' trust and learn his plans.\\nGaribaldi later learns that Edgars had created a virus that is dangerous only to telepaths.\\nIt is then revealed that after Garibaldi was captured the previous year, he was taken to the Psi Corps and re-programmed by Bester to provide information to him at the right time.\\nBester releases Garibaldi of his programming, and allows him to remember everything he had done since being kidnapped.\\nEdgars is killed by Psi Corps operatives.\\nHis wife disappears but is reunited with Garibaldi after the end of the war.\\nSheridan is tortured and interrogated by those who hope to break him and turn him into a propaganda tool for Earth\\'s totalitarian government.\\nFortunately, Garibaldi is able to help free Sheridan and return him to the campaign to free Earth.\\nAn alliance led by Babylon 5 frees Earth from totalitarian rule by president Clark in a short but bloody war.\\nThis culminates in Clark\\'s suicide and the restoration of democratic government in the Earth Alliance.\\nMars is granted full independence, and Sheridan agrees to resign his commission.\\nThe League of Non-Aligned Worlds is dissolved and reformed into the Interstellar Alliance, with Sheridan elected as its first president and continuing his command of the Rangers, who

Alliance.\\nDuring the final battle to liberate Earth from Clark\\'s regime, Ivanova is critically injured, promised only a few days to live.\\nMarcus, who had fallen in love with Ivanova, finds the same alien healing device used to revive Garibaldi at the beginning of the second season, and uses it to transfer almost all of his life energy into Ivanova, causing her to live.\\nThis causes her immense emotional anguish, and she chooses to leave Babylon 5 for another posting in EarthForce.\\nMarcus is placed into indefinite cryonic suspension at her request, pending resuscitation technology.\\nSheridan and Delenn complete their marriage ceremony while en route to Babylon 5, where they will head the Interstellar Alliance until the completion of Alliance\\'s permanent headquarters.\\nIn the season finale, the events of 100, 500, 1000, and one million years into the future are shown, depicting Babylon 5\\'s lasting influence throughout history.\\nAmong the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a pre-industrial society, the loss and restoration of humanity\\'s knowledge of space travel, and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth\\'s sun goes nova.\\nIn 2262, Earthforce Captain Elizabeth Lochley is appointed to command Babylon 5, which is now also the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance.\\nThe station grows in its role as a sanctuary for rogue

area around Lake Marsh.\\nThe scene reveals that the area is a swamp.\\nThe partners also discuss the strange weather, and mention that the newspapers could be right about \"the atom bomb explosions

Lobo, mentioning that the giant is just human and that Vornoff found him in the \"wilderness of Tibet\".\\nVornoff abruptly ends the conversation by hypnotically placing Janet back to sleep.\\nHe orders Lobo to transport the captive to Votnoff\\'s private quarters.\\nMeanwhile, Strowski silently approaches Willows House and enters through the unlocked front door.\\nWhile Strowski searches the house, Vornoff arrives to greet him.\\nThey are revealed to be old acquaintances.\\nTheir (unspecified) country of origin is interested in Vornoff\\'s groundbreaking experiments with atomic energy and wants to recruit him.\\nVornoff narrates that two decades prior to the events of the film, Vornoff had suggested using experiments with nuclear power which could create superhumans of great strength and size.\\nIn response, he was branded a madman and exiled by his country.\\nStrowski reveals that he has dreams of conquest in the name of their country, while Vornoff dreams of his creations conquering in his own name.\\nHe has no loyalty to the country which exiled him.\\nRealizing this, Strowski attacks Vornoff, but Lobo appears to defend Vornoff, and they best Strowski.\\nBy late evening, Craig and his partner return to the swamp and discover Strowski\\'s abandoned car.\\nThe partners part ways in their search of the area, with Craig heading towards Willows House.\\nBack in the secret laboratory, Vornoff uses a wave of his hand to summon Janet to his current location.\\nShe arrives dressed as a bride, summoned through telepathy.\\nHe has decided to use her as the next subject of his experiments.\\nLobo is reluctant to take part in this experiment, and Vornoff uses a whip to re-assert his control over his slave and assistant.\\nMeanwhile, Craig has entered the house and accidentally discovers the secret passage.\\nHe is himself captured by Vornoff and Lobo.\\nAs the experiment is about to begin, the camera shifts to Lobo, who is visibly distressed.\\nThe viewer is introduced to the inner struggle of the mute giant.\\nHe is torn between his loyalty to Vornoff and his infatuation with Janet.\\nTaking his decision, Lobo rebels and attacks Vornoff.\\nAfter a

flames.\\nRobbins and other officers arrive to help Craig.\\nThe police pursue Vornoff through the woods.\\nThere is another thunderstorm, and a lightning strike further destroys Willows House.\\nWith his home and equipment destroyed, a distressed Vornoff abandons Janet and merely attempts to escape.\\nCraig rolls a rock at him and lands him in the water with the octopus.\\nThe struggles with a nuclear explosion obliterate both combatants, apparently the end result of the chain reaction started at the destroyed laboratory.\\nThe film ends with Robbins commenting that Vornoff \"tampered in

which conquered most of the known universe.\\nWhile Paul is the most powerful emperor ever known, he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created.\\nAlthough 61 billion people have perished, Paul\\'s prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity.\\nMotivated by this knowledge, Paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction, while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of the Fremen religion.\\nThe Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone Paul, and the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam enlists Paul\\'s own consort Princess Irulan, daughter of the deposed Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.\\nPaul has refused to father a child with Irulan (or even touch her), but his Fremen concubine Chani has also failed to produce an heir, causing tension within his monarchy.\\nDesperate both to secure her place in the Atreides dynasty and to preserve the Atreides bloodline for the Bene Gesserit breeding program, Irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to Chani.\\nPaul is aware of this fact, but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring Chani\\'s death, and does not want to lose her.\\nHe sees this in a terrifying vision of a moon that falls from the sky of Dune.\\nBecause of the way oracles interfere with one another\\'s prescience, the Guild Navigator Edric is able to shield the conspiracy from Paul\\'s visions of the future.\\nThe Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale gives Paul a gift he cannot resist: a Tleilaxu-grown ghola of the deceased Duncan Idaho, Paul\\'s childhood teacher and friend, now called \"Hayt\".\\nThe conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul\\'s ability to rule by forcing Paul to question himself and the empire he has created.\\nFurthermore, Paul\\'s acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the Fremen, who see the Tleilaxu and their tools as unclean.\\nChani, taking matters into her own hands, switches to a traditional Fremen fertility diet, preventing Irulan from being able to tamper with her food, and

weapon called a stone burner, purchased from the Tleilaxu, that destroys the area and blinds Paul.\\nBy tradition, all blind Fremen are abandoned in the desert, but Paul shocks the Fremen and entrenches his godhood by proving he can still see, even without eyes.\\nHis oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens, as though his eyes still function.\\nBy moving through his life in lockstep with his visions, he can see even the slightest details of the world around him.\\nThe disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny, trapping him in a hellish boredom.\\nThe unraveling of the Fremen conspiracy reveals that Korba, a former Fedaykin and now high priest of Paul\\'s church, is among Paul\\'s

the throne and going into exile.\\nBijaz also implants a compulsion that will force Duncan to attempt to kill Paul, given the appropriate circumstances.\\nDuncan remains oblivious of the programming.\\nEventually, news is brought that Chani has died giving birth.\\nThe grief of his loss is the falling moon that he foresaw in an earlier vision, and Paul stumbles, truly blind now, having removed himself from the prison of his own precise vision.\\nPaul\\'s reaction to his wife\\'s death triggers the compulsions in the mind of Duncan, who attempts to kill Paul.\\nRather than kill his beloved Paul, though, Duncan\\'s ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers Duncan\\'s full consciousness.\\nHe remains conscious of the Zen-Sunni and Mentat training given to Duncan by the Tleilaxu, but is no longer bound to their programming.\\nPaul and Chani\\'s newborn twins are \"pre-born\", like Paul\\'s sister Alia had been, and come into the world fully conscious with Kwisatz Haderach-like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in Chani\\'s special pregnancy diet.\\nScytale offers to revive Chani as a ghola in return for all of Paul\\'s CHOAM holdings.\\nPaul refuses to submit to the possibility that the Tleilaxu might program Chani in some diabolical way, and Scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with Alia.\\nBy successfully escaping the oracular trap and setting the universe on a new path, Paul has been rendered completely blind, yet he is able to kill Scytale with an accurately aimed dagger due to a vision from his son\\'s perspective.\\nNow prophetically and physically blind, Paul chooses to embrace the Fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert, winning the fealty of the Fremen for his children, who will inherit his mantle of emperor.\\nPaul leaves Alia, now romantically involved with Duncan, as regent for the twins, whom he has named Leto and Ghanima.\\nDuncan notes the irony that Paul and Chani\\'s deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies, and that Paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man, while guaranteeing Fremen support for the Atreides line.\\n',\n",

what is undisputed is that De Vere called Sidney a \\'puppy\\', while Sidney responded that \"all the world knows puppies are gotten by dogs, and children by men\".\\nThe French ambassadors, whose private galleries overlooked the tennis court, were witness to the display.\\nWhether it was Sidney who next challenged De Vere to a duel or the other way around, De Vere did not take it further, and the Queen personally took Sidney to task for not recognizing the difference between his status and De Vere\\'s.\\nChristopher Hatton and Sidney\\'s friend Hubert Languet also tried to dissuade Sidney from pursuing the matter, and it was eventually dropped.\\nThe specific cause is not known, but in January 1580 De Vere wrote and challenged Sidney; by the end of the month De Vere was confined to his chambers, and was not released until early February.\\nDe Vere openly quarrelled with the Earl of Leicester about this time; he was confined to his chamber at Greenwich for some time \\'about the libelling between him and my Lord of Leicester\\'.\\nIn the summer of 1580, Gabriel Harvey, apparently motivated by a desire to ingratiate himself with Leicester, satirized De Vere\\'s love for things Italian in verses entitled Speculum Tuscanismi in Three Proper and Witty Familiar Letters.\\nAlthough details are unclear, there is evidence that in 1577 De Vere attempted to leave England to see service in the French Wars of Religion on the side of King Henry III.\\nLike many members of older established aristocratic families in England, De Vere inclined to Catholicism; after his return from Italy he was reported to have embraced the religion, perhaps after being introduced to a seminary priest, Richard Stephens, by a distant kinsman, Charles Arundell.\\nBut just as quickly, late in 1580 he denounced a group of Catholics, among them Arundell, Francis Southwell and Henry Howard, for treasonous activities and asking the Queen\\'s mercy for his own, now repudiated, Catholicism.\\nElizabeth characteristically delayed in acting on the matter and he was detained under house arrest for a short time.\\nLeicester is credited for having \"dislodged De Vere from the pro-French group\",e, the group at court which favoured Elizabeth\\'s marriage to the Duke of Anjou.\\nThe Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, was also of the view that Leicester was behind De Vere\\'s informing on his fellow Catholics in an attempt to prevent the French marriage.\\nPeck concurs, stating that Leicester was \"intent upon rendering Sussex\\'s allies politically useless\".\\nThe Privy Council ordered the arrest of both Howard and Arundell; De Vere immediately met secretly with Arundell to convince him to support his allegations against Howard and Southwell, offering him money and a pardon from the Queen.\\nArundell refused De Vere\\'s offer, and he and Howard initially sought asylum with Mendoza.\\nOnly after being assured they would be placed under house arrest in the home of a Privy Council member, did the pair give themselves up.\\nDuring the first weeks after their arrest they pursued a threefold strategy: they would admit to minor crimes, prove De Vere a liar by his offers of money to testify to his accusations, and demonstrate that their accuser posed the real danger to the Crown.\\nThe extensive list to discredit De Vere included atheism, lying, heresy, disobedience to the crown, treason, murder for hire, sexual perversion and pederasty with his English and Italian servants (\"buggering a boy that is his cook and many other boys\"), habitual drunkenness, vowing to murder various courtiers and declaring that Elizabeth had a bad singing voice.\\nArundell and Howard cleared themselves of De Vere\\'s accusations, although Howard remained under house arrest into August, while Arundell was not freed until October or November.\\nNone of the three was ever indicted or tried.\\nIn the meantime De Vere was at liberty, and won a tournament at Westminster on 22 January.\\nHis page\\'s speech at the tournament, describing De Vere\\'s appearance as the Knight of the Tree of the Sun, was published in 1592 in a pamphlet entitled Plato, Axiochus.\\nOn 14 April 1589 De Vere was among the peers who found Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, the eldest son and heir of De Vere\\'s cousin, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, guilty of treason.\\nArundel later died in prison.\\nDe Vere later insisted that \"the Howards were the most treacherous race under heaven\" and that \"my Lord Howard [was] the worst villain that lived in this earth\".\\nDuring the early 1580s it is likely that the Earl lived mainly at one of his Essex country houses, Wivenhoe, which was sold in 1584.\\nIn June 1580 he purchased a tenement and seven acres of land near Aldgate in London from the Italian merchant Benedict Spinola for Â£2,500.\\nThe property, located in the parish of St Botolphs, was known as the Great Garden of Christchurch and had formerly belonged to Magdalene College, Cambridge.\\nHe also purchased a London residence, a mansion in Bishopsgate known as Fisher\\'s Folly.\\nAccording to Henry Howard, De Vere paid a large sum for the property and renovations to it.\\nDe Vere\\'s triumph was short-lived.\\nOn 23 March 1581 Sir Francis Walsingham advised the Earl of Huntingdon that two days earlier Anne Vavasour, one of the Queen\\'s maids of honour, had given birth to a son, and that \"the Earl of Oxford is avowed to be the father, who hath withdrawn himself with intent, as it is thought, to pass the seas\".\\nDe Vere was captured and imprisoned in the Tower, as was Anne and her infant, who would later be known as Sir Edward Vere.\\nBurghley interceded for him, and he was released from the Tower on 8 June, but he remained under house arrest until sometime in July.\\nWhile De Vere was under house arrest in May, Thomas Stocker dedicated to him his Divers Sermons of Master John Calvin, stating in the dedication that he had been \"brought up in your Lordship\\'s father\\'s house\".\\nDe Vere was still under house arrest in mid-July, but took part in an Accession Day tournament at Whitehall on 17 November 1581.\\nDe Vere was banished from court until June 1583.\\nHe appealed to Burghley to intervene with the Queen on his behalf, but his father-in-law repeatedly put the matter in the hands of Sir Christopher Hatton.\\nAt Christmas 1581 De Vere reconciled with his wife, Anne, but his affair with Anne Vavasour continued to have repercussions.\\nIn March 1582 there was a skirmish in the streets of London between De Vere and Anne\\'s uncle, Sir Thomas Knyvet.\\nDe Vere was wounded and his servant killed; reports conflict as to whether Kynvet was also injured.\\nThere was another fray between Knyvet\\'s and De Vere\\'s retinues on 18 June, and a third six days later, where it was reported that Knyvet had \"slain a man of the Earl of Oxford\\'s in fight\".\\nIn a letter to Burghley three years later De Vere offered to attend his father-in-law at his house \"as well as a lame man might\";

loss of income provokes a strong reaction from her, and she says the woman herself was to blame because she had books.\\nCaptain Beatty, Montag\\'s fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing.\\nSensing Montag\\'s concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media, sports, and a quickening pace of life.\\nBooks were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in books.\\nThe government took advantage of this, and the firemen were soon hired to burn books in the name of public happiness.\\nBeatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.\\nAfter Beatty has left, Montag reveals to Mildred that over the last year he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in their air-conditioning duct.\\nIn a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in their kitchen incinerator; Montag subdues her and

ceases.\\nMontag laments Mildred\\'s suicide attempt, the woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying over their house taking part in a looming war neither he, nor anybody else, knows much about.\\nHe states that maybe the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction.\\nThe conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred\\'s friend, mrs

up the address from the dispatcher system.\\nThey drive in the firetruck recklessly to the destination.\\nMontag is stunned when the truck arrives at his house.\\nBeatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him it was Mildred and her friends who reported him.\\nMontag tries to talk to Mildred as she quickly leaves the house.\\nShe ignores him, gets into a taxi, and vanishes down the street.\\nMontag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower.\\nAs soon as he has incinerated the house, Beatty discovers Montag\\'s ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber.\\nMontag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive, and knocks his coworkers unconscious.\\nAs Montag escapes the scene, the firehouse\\'s

              " 90: 'In 1604 Fawkes became involved with a small group of English Catholics, led by Robert Catesby, who planned to assassinate the Protestant King James and replace him with his daughter, third in the line of succession, Princess Elizabeth.\\nFawkes was described by the Jesuit priest and former school friend Oswald Tesimond as \"pleasant of approach and cheerful of manner, opposed to quarrels and strife&nbsp;.\\nloyal to his friends\".\\nTesimond also claimed Fawkes was \"a man highly skilled in matters of war\", and that it was this mixture of piety and professionalism which endeared him to his fellow conspirators.\\nThe author Antonia Fraser describes Fawkes as \"a tall, powerfully built man, with thick reddish-brown hair, a flowing moustache in the tradition of the time, and a bushy reddish-brown beard\", and that he was \"a man of action&nbsp;.\\ncapable of intelligent argument as well as physical endurance, somewhat to the surprise of his enemies\".\\nThe first meeting of the five central conspirators took place on Sunday 20 May 1604, at an inn called the Duck and Drake, in the fashionable Strand district of London.\\nCatesby had already proposed at an earlier meeting with Thomas Wintour and John Wright to kill the King and his government by blowing up \"the Parliament House with gunpowder\".\\nWintour, who at first objected to the plan, was convinced by Catesby to travel to the continent to seek help.\\nWintour met with the Constable of Castile, the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would receive no support from Spain.\\nOwen did, however, introduce Wintour to Fawkes, who had by then been away from England for many years, and thus was largely unknown in the country.\\nWintour and Fawkes were contemporaries; each was militant, and had first-hand experience of the unwillingness of the Spaniards to help.\\nWintour told Fawkes of their plan to \"doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott\", and thus in April 1604 the two men returned to England.\\nWintour\\'s news did not surprise Catesby; despite positive noises from the Spanish authorities, he feared that \"the deeds would nott answere\".\\nOne of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was promoted in June 1604, gaining access to a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King\\'s Wardrobe.\\nFawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy.\\nThe contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour\\'s confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard\\'s house to Parliament, although this story may have been a government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel.\\nIf the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.\\nThey ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.\\nFawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant\\'s widow was clearing out a nearby undercroft, directly beneath the House of Lords.\\nThe plotters purchased the lease to the room, which also belonged to John Whynniard.\\nUnused and filthy, it was considered an ideal hiding place for the gunpowder the plotters planned to store.\\nAccording to Fawkes, 20&nbsp;barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16&nbsp;more on 20 July.\\nOn 28 July however, the ever-present threat of the plague delayed the opening of Parliament until Tuesday, 5 November.\\nIn an attempt to gain foreign support, in May 1605 Fawkes travelled overseas and informed Hugh Owen of the plotters\\' plan.\\nAt some point during this trip his name made its way into the files of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who employed a network of spies across Europe.\\nOne of these spies, Captain William Turner, may have been responsible.\\nAlthough the information he provided to Salisbury usually amounted to no more than a vague pattern of invasion reports, and included nothing which regarded the Gunpowder Plot, on 21 April he told how Fawkes was to be brought by Tesimond to England.\\nFawkes was a well-known Flemish mercenary, and would be introduced to \"Mr Catesby\" and \"honourable friends of the nobility and others who would have arms and horses in readiness\".\\nTurner\\'s report did not, however, mention Fawkes\\'s pseudonym in England, John Johnson, and did not reach Cecil until late in November, well after the plot had been discovered.\\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.\\nMore gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.\\nFawkes\\'s final role in the plot was settled during a series of meetings in October.\\nHe was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames.\\nSimultaneously, a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth.\\nActs of regicide were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to the continent, where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.\\nA few of the conspirators were concerned about fellow Catholics who would be present at Parliament during the opening.\\nOn the evening of 26 October, Lord Monteagle received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away, and to \"retyre

of Monteagle\\'s servantsthe conspirators resolved to continue with their plans, as it appeared that it \"was clearly thought to be a hoax\".\\nFawkes checked the undercroft on 30 October, and reported that nothing had been disturbed.\\nMonteagle\\'s suspicions had been aroused, however, and the letter was shown to King James.\\nThe King ordered Sir Thomas Knyvet to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November.\\nFawkes had taken up his station late on the previous night, armed with a slow match and a watch given to him by Percy \"becaus he should knowe howe the time went away\".\\nHe was found leaving the cellar, shortly after midnight, and arrested.\\nInside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.\\nFawkes gave his name as John Johnson and was first interrogated by members of the King\\'s Privy chamber, where he remained defiant.\\nWhen asked by one of the lords what he was doing in possession of so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered that his intention was \"to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains\".\\nHe identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his father\\'s name as Thomas and his mother\\'s as Edith Jackson.\\nWounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of pleurisy.\\nFawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so.\\nHis steadfast manner earned him the admiration of King James, who described Fawkes as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".\\nJames\\'s admiration did not, however, prevent him from ordering on 6 November that \"John Johnson\" be tortured, to reveal the names of his co-conspirators.\\nHe directed that the torture be light at first, referring to the use of manacles, but more severe if necessary, authorising the use of the rack: \"the gentler Tortures are to be first used unto him et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur [and so by degrees proceeding to the worst]\".\\nFawkes was transferred to the Tower of London.\\nThe King composed a list of questions to be put to \"Johnson\", such as \"as to what he is, For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him\", \"When and where he learned to speak French.\\n\", and \"If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it.\\n\" The room in which Fawkes was interrogated subsequently became known as the Guy Fawkes Room.\\nSir William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, supervised the torture and obtained Fawkes\\'s confession.\\nHe searched his prisoner, and found a letter, addressed to Guy Fawkes.\\nTo Waad\\'s surprise, \"Johnson\" remained silent, revealing nothing about the plot or its authors.\\nOn the night of 6 November he spoke with Waad, who reported to Salisbury \"He [Johnson] told us that since he undertook this action he did every day pray to God he might perform that which might be for the advancement of the Catholic Faith and saving his own soul\".\\nAccording to Waad, Fawkes managed to rest through the night, despite his being warned that he would be interrogated until \"I had gotton the inwards secret of his thoughts and all his complices\".\\nHis composure was broken at some point during the following day.\\nThe observer Sir Edward Hoby remarked \"Since Johnson\\'s being in the Tower, he beginneth to speak English\".\\nFawkes revealed his true identity on 7 November, and told his interrogators that there were five people involved in the plot to kill the King.\\nHe began to reveal their names on 8 November, and told how they intended to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne.\\nHis third confession, on 9 November, implicated Francis Tresham.\\nFollowing the Ridolfi plot of 1571 prisoners were made to dictate their confessions, before copying and signing them, if they still could.\\nAlthough it is uncertain if he was tortured on the rack, Fawkes\\'s scrawled signature bears testament to the suffering he endured at the hands of his interrogators.\\nThe trial of eight of the plotters began on Monday 27 January 1606.\\nFawkes shared the barge from the Tower to Westminster Hall with seven of his co-conspirators.\\nThey were kept in the Star Chamber before being taken to Westminster Hall, where they were displayed on a purpose-built scaffold.\\nThe King and his close family, watching in secret, were among the spectators as the Lords Commissioners read out the list of charges.\\nFawkes was identified as Guido Fawkes, \"otherwise called Guido Johnson\".\\nHe pleaded not guilty, despite his apparent acceptance of guilt from the moment he was captured.\\nThe outcome was never in doubt.\\nThe jury found all the defendants guilty, and the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham found them guilty of high treason.\\nThe Attorney General Sir Edward Coke told the court that each of the condemned would be drawn backwards to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground.\\nThey were to be \"put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both\".\\nTheir genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed.\\nThey would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become \"prey for the fowls of the air\".\\nFawkes\\'s and Tresham\\'s testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot.\\nThe last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells.\\nThe two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy.\\nWhen the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.\\nOn 31 January 1606, Fawkes and three others&nbsp;â\\x80\\x93 Thomas Wintour, Ambrose Rookwood, and Robert Keyes&nbsp;â\\x80\\x93 were dragged (ie.\\ndrawn) from the Tower on wattled hurdles to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had attempted to destroy.\\nHis fellow plotters were then hanged and quartered.\\nFawkes was the last to stand on the scaffold.\\nHe asked for forgiveness of the King and state, while keeping up his \"crosses and idle ceremonies\" (Catholic practices).\\nWeakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck.\\nHis lifeless body was nevertheless quartered and, as was the custom, his body parts were then distributed to \"the four corners of the kingdom\", to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.\\n',\n",

capacity as members of the House of Lords, along with the members of the House of Commons.\\nAnother important objective was the kidnapping of the King\\'s daughter, third in the line of succession, Princess Elizabeth.\\nHoused at Coombe Abbey near Coventry, the Princess lived only ten miles north of Warwickâ\\x80\\x94convenient for the plotters, most of whom lived in the Midlands.\\nOnce the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen.\\nThe fate of Princes Henry and Charles would be improvised; their role in state ceremonies was, as yet, uncertain.\\nThe plotters planned to use Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, as Elizabeth\\'s Protector, but most likely never informed him of this.\\nRobert Catesby (1573â\\x80\\x931605), a man of \"ancient, historic and distinguished lineage\", was the inspiration behind the plot.\\nHe was described by contemporaries as \"a good-looking man, about six feet tall, athletic and a good swordsman\".\\nAlong with several other conspirators, he took part in the Earl of Essex\\'s rebellion in 1601, during which he was wounded and captured.\\nQueen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000&nbsp;marks (equivalent to more than Â£6&nbsp;million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in Chastleton.\\nIn 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, Philip III, urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics.\\nThomas Wintour (1571â\\x80\\x931606) was chosen as the emissary, but the Spanish king, although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England, was intent on making peace with James.\\nWintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that \"3,000 Catholics\" were ready and waiting to support such an invasion.\\nConcern was voiced by Pope Clement VIII that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained.\\nAccording to contemporary accounts, in February 1604 Catesby invited Thomas Wintour to his house in Lambeth, where they discussed Catesby\\'s plan to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament.\\nWintour was known as a competent scholar, able to speak several languages, and he had fought with the English army in the Netherlands.\\nHis uncle, Francis Ingleby, had been executed for being a Catholic priest in 1586, and Wintour later converted to Catholicism.\\nAlso present at the meeting was John Wright, a devout Catholic said to be one of the best swordsmen of his day, and a man who had taken part with Catesby in the Earl of Essex\\'s rebellion three years earlier.\\nDespite his reservations over the possible repercussions should the attempt fail, Wintour agreed to join the conspiracy, perhaps persuaded by Catesby\\'s rhetoric: \"Let us give the attempt and where it faileth, pass no further\".\\nWintour travelled to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support.\\nWhile there he sought out Guy Fawkes (1570â\\x80\\x931606), a committed Catholic who had served as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands under the command of William Stanley, and who in 1603 was recommended for a captaincy.\\nAccompanied by John Wright\\'s brother Christopher, Fawkes had also been a member of the 1603 delegation to the Spanish court pleading for an invasion of England.\\nWintour told Fawkes that \"some good frends of his wished his company in Ingland\", and that certain gentlemen \"were uppon a resolution to doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spain healped us nott\".\\nThe two men returned to England late in April 1604, telling Catesby that Spanish support was unlikely.\\nThomas Percy, Catesby\\'s friend and John Wright\\'s brother-in-law, was introduced to the plot several weeks later.\\nPercy had found employment with his kinsman the Earl of Northumberland, and by 1596 was his agent for the family\\'s northern estates.\\nAbout 1600â\\x80\\x931601 he served with his patron in the Low Countries.\\nAt some point during Northumberland\\'s command in the Low Countries, Percy became his agent in his communications with James.\\nPercy was reputedly a \"serious\" character who had converted to the Catholic faith.\\nHis early years were, according to a Catholic source, marked by a tendency to rely on \"his sword and personal courage\".\\nNorthumberland, although not a Catholic himself, planned to build a strong relationship with James in order to better the prospects of English Catholics, and to reduce the family disgrace caused by his separation from his wife Martha Wright, a favourite of Elizabeth.\\nThomas Percy\\'s meetings with James seemed to go well.\\nPercy returned with promises of support for the Catholics, and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence.\\nPercy, keen to improve his standing, went further, claiming that the future King would guarantee the safety of English Catholics.\\nThe first meeting between the five conspirators took place on 20&nbsp;May 1604, probably at the Duck and Drake Inn, just off the Strand, Thomas Wintour\\'s usual residence when staying in London.\\nCatesby, Thomas Wintour, and John Wright were in attendance, joined by Guy Fawkes and Thomas Percy.\\nAlone in a private room, the five plotters swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book.\\nBy coincidence, and ignorant of the plot, Father John Gerard (a friend of Catesby\\'s) was celebrating Mass in another room, and the five men subsequently received the Eucharist.\\nFollowing their oath, the plotters left London and returned to their homes.\\nThe adjournment of Parliament gave them, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans.\\nOn 9&nbsp;June, Percy\\'s patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, a mounted troop of 50&nbsp;bodyguards to the King.\\nThis role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a small property near the Prince\\'s Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen.\\nPercy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland\\'s agents, Dudley Carleton and John Hippisley.\\nFawkes, using the pseudonym \"John Johnson\", took charge of the building, posing as Percy\\'s servant.\\nThe building was occupied by Scottish commissioners appointed by the King to consider his plans for the unification of England and Scotland, so the plotters hired Catesby\\'s lodgings in Lambeth, on the opposite bank of the Thames, from where their stored gunpowder and other supplies could be conveniently rowed across each night.\\nMeanwhile, King James continued with his policies against the Catholics, and Parliament pushed through anti-Catholic legislation, until its adjournment on 7&nbsp;July.\\nThe conspirators returned to London in October 1604, when Robert Keyes, a \"desperate man, ruined and indebted\", was admitted to the group.\\nHis responsibility was to take charge of Catesby\\'s house in Lambeth, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored.\\nKeyes\\'s family had notable connections; his wife\\'s employer was the Catholic Lord Mordaunt.\\nTall, with a red beard, he was seen as trustworthy and, like Fawkes, capable of looking after himself.\\nIn December Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it.\\nIt was announced on 24&nbsp;December that the re-opening of Parliament would be delayed.\\nConcern over the plague meant that rather than sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3&nbsp;October 1605.\\nThe contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament.\\nThis may have been a government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found.\\nThe account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour\\'s confession, and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation.\\nLogistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining.\\nIf the story is true, by 6&nbsp;December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.\\nThey ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.\\nThe noise turned out to be the then-tenant\\'s widow, who was clearing out the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lordsâ\\x80\\x94the room where the plotters eventually stored the gunpowder.\\nBy the time the plotters reconvened at the start of the old style new year on Lady Day, 25&nbsp;March, three more had been admitted to their ranks; Robert Wintour, John Grant, and Christopher Wright.\\nThe additions of Wintour and Wright were obvious choices.\\nAlong with a small fortune, Robert Wintour inherited Huddington Court (a known refuge for priests) near Worcester, and was reputedly a generous and well-liked man.\\nA devout Catholic, he married Gertrude Talbot, who was from a family of recusants.\\nChristopher Wright (1568â\\x80\\x931605), John\\'s brother, had also taken part in the Earl of Essex\\'s revolt and had moved his family to Twigmore in Lincolnshire, then known as something of a haven for priests.\\nJohn Grant was married to Wintour\\'s sister, Dorothy, and was lord of the manor of Norbrook near Stratford-upon-Avon.\\nReputed to be an intelligent, thoughtful man, he sheltered Catholics at his home at Snitterfield, and was another who had been involved in the Essex revolt of 1601.\\nIn addition, 25&nbsp;March was the day on which the plotters purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near to, owned by John Whynniard.\\nThe Palace of Westminster in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts.\\nThe old palace was easily accessible; merchants, lawyers, and others lived and worked in the lodgings, shops, and taverns within its precincts.\\nWhynniard\\'s building was along a right-angle to the House of Lords, alongside a passageway called Parliament Place, which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the River Thames.\\nUndercrofts were common features at the time, used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood.\\nWhynniard\\'s undercroft, on the ground floor, was directly beneath the first-floor House of Lords, and may once have been part of the palace\\'s medieval kitchen.\\nUnused and filthy, its location was ideal for what the group planned to do.\\nIn the second week of June Catesby met in London the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, and asked him about the morality of entering into an undertaking which might involve the destruction of the innocent, together with the guilty.\\nGarnet answered that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex, showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion.\\nSoon after, the Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond told Garnet he had taken Catesby\\'s confession, in the course of which he had learnt of the plot.\\nGarnet and Catesby met for a third time on 24&nbsp;July 1605, at the house of the wealthy catholic Anne Vaux in Enfield Chase.\\nGarnet decided that Tesimond\\'s account had been given under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law therefore forbade him to repeat what he had heard.\\nWithout acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, Garnet attempted to dissuade Catesby from his course, to no avail.\\nGarnet wrote to a colleague in Rome, Claudio Acquaviva, expressing his concerns about open rebellion in England.\\nHe also told Acquaviva that \"there is a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King\", and urged the pope to issue a public brief against the use of force.\\nAccording to Fawkes, 20&nbsp;barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16&nbsp;more on 20&nbsp;July.\\nThe supply of gunpowder was theoretically controlled by the government, but it was easily obtained from illicit sources.\\nOn 28&nbsp;July, the ever-present threat of the plague again delayed the opening of Parliament, this time until Tuesday 5&nbsp;November.\\nFawkes left the country for a short time.\\nThe King, meanwhile, spent much of the summer away from the city, hunting.\\nHe stayed wherever was convenient, including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics.\\nGarnet, convinced that the threat of an uprising had receded, travelled the country on a pilgrimage.\\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.\\nMore gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.\\nThe final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605.\\nAt Michaelmas, Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic Ambrose Rookwood to rent Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon.\\nRookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at Coldham Hall in Stanningfield, Suffolk was an important factor in his enlistment.\\nHis parents, Robert Rookwood and Dorothea Drury, were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near Calais.\\nEverard Digby was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire.\\nHe had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard.\\nDigby and his wife, Mary Mulshaw, had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends.\\nDigby was asked by Catesby to rent Coughton Court near Alcester.\\nDigby also promised Â£1,500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster.\\nFinally, on 14&nbsp;October Catesby invited Francis Tresham into the conspiracy.\\nTresham was the son of the Catholic Thomas Tresham, and a cousin to Robert Catesbyâ\\x80\\x94the two had been raised together.\\nHe was also the heir to his father\\'s large fortune, which had been depleted by recusant fines, expensive tastes, and by Francis and Catesby\\'s involvement in the Essex revolt.\\nCatesby and Tresham met at the home of Tresham\\'s brother-in-law and cousin, Lord Stourton.\\nIn his confession, Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls, to which Catesby had replied it would not, and that the plight of England\\'s Catholics required that it be done.\\nCatesby also apparently asked for Â£2,000, and the use of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire.\\nTresham declined both offers (although he did give Â£100 to Thomas Wintour), and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot; hardly the actions of a guilty man, he claimed.\\nThe details of the plot were finalised in October, in a series of taverns across London and Daventry.\\nFawkes would be left to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames, while simultaneously a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth.\\nFawkes would leave for the continent, to explain events in England to the European Catholic powers.\\nThe wives of those involved and Anne Vaux (a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected was about to happen.\\nSeveral of the conspirators expressed worries about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament on the day of the planned explosion.\\nPercy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and the young Earl of Arundel\\'s name was brought up; Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day.\\nThe Lords Vaux, Montague, Monteagle, and Stourton were also mentioned.\\nKeyes suggested warning Lord Mordaunt, his wife\\'s employer, to derision from Catesby.\\nOn Saturday 26&nbsp;October, Monteagle (Tresham\\'s brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton.\\nHaving broken the seal, he handed the letter to a servant who read it aloud:  Uncertain of the letter\\'s meaning, Monteagle promptly rode to Whitehall and handed it to Cecil (then Earl of Salisbury).\\nSalisbury informed the Earl of Worcester, considered to have recusant sympathies, and the suspected papist Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, but kept news of the plot from the King, who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days.\\nMonteagle\\'s servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal.\\nCatesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator.\\nTresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot.\\nSalisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved.\\nHe therefore elected to wait, to see how events unfolded.\\nThe letter was shown to the King on Friday 1 November following his arrival back in London.\\nUpon reading it, James immediately seized upon the word \"blow\" and felt that it hinted at \"some strategem of fire and powder\", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, at Kirk o\\' Field in 1567.\\nKeen not to seem too intriguing, and wanting to allow the King to take the credit for unveiling the conspiracy, Salisbury feigned ignorance.\\nThe following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the Palace of Whitehall and informed him that, based on the information that Salisbury had given them a week earlier, on Monday the Lord Chamberlain Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament, \"both above and below\".\\nOn Sunday 3&nbsp;November Percy, Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting, where Percy told his colleagues that they should \"abide the uttermost triall\", and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames.\\nBy 4&nbsp;November Digby was ensconced with a \"hunting party\" at Dunchurch, ready to abduct Princess Elizabeth.\\nThe same day, Percy visited the Earl of Northumberlandâ\\x80\\x94who was uninvolved in the conspiracyâ\\x80\\x94to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter to Monteagle.\\nPercy returned to London and assured Wintour, John Wright, and Robert Keyes that they had nothing to be concerned about, and returned to his lodgings on Gray\\'s Inn Road.\\nThat same evening Catesby, likely accompanied by John Wright and Bates, set off for the Midlands.\\nFawkes visited Keyes, and was given a pocket watch left by Percy, to time the fuse, and an hour later Rookwood received several engraved swords from a local cutler.\\nAlthough two accounts of the number of searches and their timing exist, according to the King\\'s version, the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4&nbsp;Novemberâ\\x80\\x94as the plotters were busy making their final preparationsâ\\x80\\x94by Suffolk, Monteagle, and John Whynniard.\\nThey found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man (Fawkes), who told them that the firewood belonged to his master, Thomas Percy.\\nThey left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building.\\nThe mention of Percy\\'s name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator.\\nThe King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken.\\nLate that night, the search party, headed by Thomas Knyvet, returned to the undercroft.\\nThey again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs.\\nHe was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson.\\nHe was carrying a lantern now held in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch, several slow matches and touchwood.\\n36 barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of faggots and coal.\\nFawkes was taken to the King early on the morning of 5&nbsp;November.\\nAs news of \"John Johnson\\'s\" arrest spread among the plotters still in London, most fled northwest, along Watling Street.\\nChristopher Wright and Thomas Percy left together.\\nRookwood left soon after, and managed to cover 30&nbsp;miles in two hours on one horse.\\nHe overtook Keyes, who had set off earlier, then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill, before catching Catesby, John Wright, and Bates on the same road.\\nReunited, the group continued northwest to Dunchurch, using horses provided by Digby.\\nKeyes went to Mordaunt\\'s house at Drayton.\\nMeanwhile, Thomas Wintour stayed in London, and even went to Westminster to see what was happening.\\nWhen he realised the plot had been uncovered, he took his horse and made for his sister\\'s house at Norbrook, before continuing to Huddington Court.\\nThe group of six conspirators stopped at Ashby St Ledgers at about 6&nbsp;pm, where they met Robert Wintour and updated him on their situation.\\nThey then continued on to Dunchurch, and met with Digby.\\nCatesby convinced him that despite the plot\\'s failure, an armed struggle was still a real possibility.\\nHe announced to Digby\\'s \"hunting party\" that the King and Salisbury were dead, before the fugitives moved west to Warwick.\\nIn London, news of the plot was spreading, and the authorities set extra guards on the city gates, closed the ports, and protected the house of the Spanish Ambassador, which was surrounded by an angry mob.\\nAn arrest warrant was issued against Thomas Percy, and his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, was placed under house arrest.\\nIn \"John Johnson\\'s\" initial interrogation he revealed nothing other than the name of his mother, and that he was from Yorkshire.\\nA letter to Guy Fawkes was discovered on his person, but he claimed that name was one of his aliases.\\nFar from denying his intentions, \"Johnson\" stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and Parliament.\\nNevertheless, he maintained his composure and insisted that he had acted alone.\\nHis unwillingness to yield so impressed the King that he described him as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".\\nOn 6 November, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir John Popham (a man with a deep-seated hatred of Catholics) questioned Rookwood\\'s servants.\\nBy the evening he had learned the names of several of those involved in the conspiracy: Catesby, Rookwood, Keyes, Wynter , John and Christopher Wright, and Grant.\\n\"Johnson\" meanwhile persisted with his story, and along with the gunpowder he was found with, was moved to the Tower of London, where the King had decided that \"Johnson\" would be tortured.\\nThe use of torture was forbidden, except by royal prerogative or a body such as the Privy Council or Star Chamber.\\nIn a letter of 6&nbsp;November James wrote: \"The gentler tortours [tortures] are to be first used unto him, et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur [and thus by steps extended to greater ones], and so God speed your good work\".\\n\"Johnson\" may have been placed in manacles and hung from the wall, but he was almost certainly subjected to the horrors of the rack.\\nOn 7&nbsp;November his resolve was broken; he confessed late that day, and again over the following two days.\\nOn 6&nbsp;November, with Fawkes maintaining his silence, the fugitives raided Warwick Castle for supplies and continued to Norbrook to collect weapons.\\nFrom there they continued their journey to Huddington.\\nBates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army.\\nGarnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their \"wicked actions\", before himself fleeing.\\nSeveral priests set out for Warwick, worried about the fate of their colleagues.\\nThey were caught, and then imprisoned in London.\\nCatesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour.\\nThey received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason.\\nThey continued on to Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire, the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers.\\nTired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out.\\nAlthough gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained, a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and a man named Morgan (a member of the hunting party).\\nThomas Wintour and Littleton, on their way from Huddington to Holbeche House, were told by a messenger that Catesby had died.\\nAt that point, Littleton left, but Thomas arrived at the house to find Catesby alive, albeit scorched.\\nJohn Grant was not so lucky, and had been blinded by the fire.\\nDigby, Robert Wintour and his half-brother John, and Thomas Bates, had all left.\\nOf the plotters, only the singed figures of Catesby and Grant, and the Wright brothers, Rookwood, and Percy, remained.\\nThe fugitives resolved to stay in the house and wait for the arrival of the King\\'s men.\\nRichard Walsh (Sheriff of Worcestershire) and his company of 200&nbsp;men besieged Holbeche House on the morning of 8&nbsp;November.\\nThomas Wintour was hit in the shoulder while crossing the courtyard.\\nJohn Wright was shot, followed by his brother, and then Rookwood.\\nCatesby and Percy were reportedly killed by a single lucky shot.\\nThe attackers rushed the property, and stripped the dead or dying defenders of their clothing.\\nGrant, Morgan, Rookwood, and Wintour were arrested.\\n',\n",

              " 98: 'Aboard the Nellie, anchored in the River Thames near Gravesend, England, Charles Marlow tells his fellow sailors about the events that led to his appointment as captain of a river steamboat for an ivory trading company.\\nAs a child, Marlow had been fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into \"a place of darkness\" (Conrad 10).\\nYet there remained a big river, \"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land\" (Conrad 10).\\nThe image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a snake would a bird\" (Conrad 10).\\nFeeling as though \"instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior (Conrad 18).\\nAfter more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of the government near the mouth of the big river.\\nMarlow, still some two hundred miles to go, now takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede.\\nHe departs some thirty miles up the river where his Company\\'s station is.\\nWork on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives.\\nMarlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now await their deaths, their sickened bodies already as thin as air (Conrad 24-25).\\nMarlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck\" (Conrad 26).\\nMarlow has to wait for ten days in the Company\\'s Outer Station, where he sleeps in a hut.\\nAt this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the Company\\'s impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a mr Kurtz, who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a \"\\'very remarkable person\\'\" who \"\\'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together\\'\" (Conrad 28).\\nThe agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"\\'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long.\\nThey, aboveâ\\x80\\x94the Council in Europe, you knowâ\\x80\\x94mean him to be\\'\" (Conrad 29).\\nMarlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot some two hundred miles into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based.\\nOn the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees, and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat had been wrecked in a mysterious accident two days earlier.\\nHe meets the General Manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved, and rumors had one important station in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional mr Kurtz, was ill.\\n\"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks irritated (Conrad 34).\\nHe fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives.\\nWhile one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station\\'s brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks.\\nMarlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him, and is curious to know what kind of information he is after.\\nHanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\" (Conrad 39).\\nMarlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman\\'s face, and is informed that mr Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago.\\nThe brick-maker calls Kurtz \"\\'a prodigy\\'\" and \"\\'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress\\'\", and feels Kurtz represents the \"\\'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose\\'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with (Conrad 39).\\nThe man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: \"\\'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you\\'\" (Conrad 39-40).\\nMarlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs, made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station.\\nDuring this time, he learns that Kurtz is far from admired, but more or less resented (mostly by the manager).\\nOnce underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz\\'s station takes two months to the day.\\nThe steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.\\nThe journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station.\\nIn the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog.\\nFrom the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour.\\nA few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest.\\nThe helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow\\'s feet.\\nMarlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease.\\nMarlow and a pilgrim watch the helmsman die.\\nIn a flash forward, Marlow notes that the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently.\\nA handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads \"Exterminate all the brutes.\\n\" (Conrad 83).\\nAt Kurtz\\'s station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land.\\nThe pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve mr Kurtz.\\nThe man from the bank boards the steamboat, and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz\\'s camp.\\nHe explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut.\\nThrough conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late.\\nThe Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life, and justice, and suggests that he is a poet.\\nHe tells of how Kurtz opened his mind, and seems to admire him even for his powerâ\\x80\\x94and for his willingness to use it.\\nMarlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.\\nFrom the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives.\\nAround the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher.\\nThe area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest.\\nThe pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation.\\nMarlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer.\\nWhen the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company\\'s business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\".\\nLater, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.\\nAfter midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore.\\nHe goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help.\\nMarlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region.\\nThe next day they prepare for their journey back down the river.\\nThe natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly.\\nNoticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives.\\nOnly the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms.\\nThe pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.\\nKurtz\\'s health worsens on the return trip, and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill.\\nThe steamboat breaks down and, while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager.\\nWhen Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper: \"The horror.\\nThe horror.\\n\" (Conrad 116).\\nA short while later, the \"manager\\'s boy\" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, \"Mistah Kurtzâ\\x80\\x94he dead\" (Conrad 117).\\nThe next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury \"something\" in a muddy hole (Conrad 117).\\nHe falls very ill, himself near death.\\nUpon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the \"civilised\" world.\\nMany callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in.\\nHe then gives Kurtz\\'s report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit.\\nFinally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz\\'s fiancÃ©e, whom Kurtz referred to as \"My Intended\" (Conrad 79).\\nWhen Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz\\'s death.\\nShe presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz\\'s final words, which in fact are \"The horror.\\nThe horror.\\n\" Uncomfortable, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz\\'s final word was her name.\\n',\n",

she finds appeal in Urquhart\\'s much older age and later refers to him as \"Daddy\".\\nAnother unwitting pawn is Roger O\\'Neill (Miles Anderson), the party\\'s cocaine-addicted public relations consultant.\\nUrquhart blackmails O\\'Neill into leaking information on budget cuts that humiliates Collingridge during the Prime Minister\\'s Questions.\\nLater, he blames party chairman Lord \"Teddy\" Billsborough (Nicholas Selby) for leaking an internal poll showing a drop in Tory numbers, leading Collingridge to sack him.\\nAs Collingridge\\'s image suffers, Urquhart encourages ultraconservative Foreign Secretary Patrick Woolton (Malcolm Tierney) and Chronicle owner Benjamin Landless to support his removal.\\nUrquhart also poses as Collingridge\\'s alcoholic brother, Charles, to trade shares in a chemical company about to benefit from advance information confidential to the government.\\nConsequently, Collingridge becomes falsely accused of insider trading and is forced to resign.\\nIn the ensuing leadership race, Urquhart initially feigns unwillingness to stand before announcing his candidacy.\\nWith the help of his underling, Tim Stamper (Colin Jeavons), Urquhart goes about making sure his competitors drop out of the race: Health Secretary Peter MacKenzie (Christopher Owen) accidentally runs his car over a disabled protester at a demonstration staged by Urquhart and is forced by the public outcry to withdraw, while Education Secretary Harold Earle (Kenneth Gilbert) is blackmailed into withdrawing when Urquhart anonymously sends pictures of him in the company of a rent boy whom Earle had paid for sex.\\nThe first ballot leaves Urquhart to face Woolton and Michael Samuels, the moderate Environment Secretary supported by Billsborough.\\nUrquhart eliminates Woolton by a prolonged scheme: at the party conference, he pressures O\\'Neill into persuading his personal assistant and lover, Penny Guy (Alphonsia Emmanuel), to have a one-night stand with Woolton in his suite, which Urquhart records via a bugged ministerial red box.\\nWhen the tape is sent to Woolton, he is led to assume that Samuels is behind the scheme and backs Urquhart in the contest.\\nUrquhart also receives support from Collingridge, who is unaware of Urquhart\\'s role in his own downfall.\\nSamuels is forced out of the running when the tabloids reveal that he backed leftist causes as a student at University of Cambridge.\\nStumbling across contradictions in the allegations against Collingridge and his brother, Mattie begins to dig deeper.\\nOn Urquhart\\'s orders, O\\'Neill arranges for her car and flat to be vandalised in a show of intimidation.\\nHowever, O\\'Neill becomes increasingly uneasy with what he is being asked to do, and his cocaine addiction adds to his instability.\\nUrquhart mixes O\\'Neill\\'s cocaine with rat poison, causing him to kill himself when taking the cocaine in a motorway lavatory.\\nThough initially blind to the truth of matters thanks to her relations with Urquhart, Mattie eventually deduces that Urquhart is responsible for O\\'Neill\\'s death and is behind the unfortunate downfalls of Collingridge and all of Urquhart\\'s rivals.\\nMattie looks for Urquhart at the point when it seems his victory is certain.\\nShe eventually finds him on the roof garden of the Houses of Parliament, where she confronts him.\\nHe admits to O\\'Neill\\'s murder and everything else he has done.\\nHe then asks whether he can trust Mattie, and, though she answers in the affirmative, he does not believe her and throws her off the roof onto a van parked below.\\nAn unseen person picks up Mattie\\'s tape recorder, which she had been using to secretly record her conversations with Urquhart.\\nThe series ends with Urquhart defeating Samuels in the second leadership ballot and being driven to Buckingham Palace to be invited to form a government by Elizabeth II.\\n',\n",

however, Pap kidnaps Huck and leaves town with him.\\nPap forcibly moves Huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the Illinois shoreline.\\nBecause of Pap\\'s drunken violence and imprisonment of Huck inside the cabin, Huck, during one of his father\\'s absences, elaborately fakes his own death, escapes from the cabin, and sets off down river.\\nHe settles comfortably, on Jackson\\'s Island.\\nHere, Huck reunites with Jim, Miss Watson\\'s slave.\\nJim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him \"down the river\" to presumably more brutal owners.\\nJim plans to make his way to the town of Cairo in Illinois, a free state, so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family\\'s freedom.\\nAt first, Huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave, but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions, Huck emotionally connects with Jim, who increasingly becomes Huck\\'s close friend and guardian.\\nAfter heavy flooding on the river, the two find a raft (which they keep) as well as an entire house floating on the river.\\nEntering the house to seek loot, Jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor, shot in the back.\\nHe prevents Huck from viewing the corpse.\\nTo find out the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area.\\nHuck learns from her about the news of his own supposed murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away he is also a suspect and a reward for Jim\\'s capture has initiated a manhunt.\\nmrs Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests.\\nOnce he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing.\\nHuck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson\\'s Island that very night.\\nThe two hastily load up the raft and depart.\\nAfter a while, Huck and Jim come across a grounded steamship.\\nSearching it, they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering a third, but they flee before being noticed.\\nThey are later separated in a fog, making Jim intensely anxious, and when they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident.\\nJim is not deceived for long, and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly.\\nHuck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.\\nTravelling onward, Huck and Jim\\'s raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating the two.\\nHuck is given shelter on the Kentucky side of the river by the Grangerfords, an \"aristocratic\" family.\\nHe befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year blood feud against another family, the Shepherdsons.\\nThe Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love.\\nThe vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck\\'s older sister elopes with a member of the Shepherdson clan.\\nIn the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses.\\nHe is immensely relieved to be reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.\\nNear the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck take two on-the-run grifters aboard the raft.\\nThe younger man, who is about thirty, introduces himself as the long-lost son of an English duke (the Duke of Bridgewater).\\nThe older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the Lost Dauphin, the son of Louis XVI and rightful King of France.\\nThe \"duke\" and \"king\" soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck\\'s raft, committing a series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey.\\nTo divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the \"Sick Arab\" so that he can move about the raft without bindings.\\nOn one occasion, the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called \"The Royal Nonesuch\".\\nThe play turns out to be only a couple of minutes\\' worth of an absurd, bawdy sham.\\nOn the afternoon of the first performance, a drunk called Boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named Colonel Sherburn; a lynch mob forms to retaliate against Sherburn; and Sherburn, surrounded at his home, disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done.\\nBy the third night of \"The Royal Nonesuch\", the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam, but the two cleverly skip town together with Huck and Jim just before the performance begins.\\nIn the next town, the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property.\\nTo match accounts of Wilks\\'s brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke pretends to be a deaf-mute, while starting to collect Wilks\\'s inheritance.\\nHuck decides that Wilks\\'s three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance.\\nIn a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks\\'s coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning.\\nThe arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again.\\nSuddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck\\'s despair.\\nWhen Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward.\\nDefying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actionsâ\\x80\\x94\"All right, then, I\\'ll go to hell.\\n\"â\\x80\\x94Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.\\nHuck learns that Jim is being held at the plantation of Silas and Sally Phelps.\\nThe family\\'s nephew, Tom, is expected for a visit at the same time as Huck\\'s arrival, so Huck is mistaken for Tom and welcomed into their home.\\nHe plays along, hoping to find Jim\\'s location and free him; in a surprising plot twist, it is revealed that the expected nephew is in fact Tom Sawyer.\\nWhen Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck\\'s scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, Sid, while Huck continues pretending to be Tom.\\nIn the meantime, Jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for \"The Royal Nonesuch\", and so the townspeople capture the duke and king, who are then tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail.\\nRather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held, Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim\\'s food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme.\\nDuring the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone.\\nAlthough a local doctor admires Jim\\'s decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the Phelps.\\nAfter this, events quickly resolve themselves.\\nTom\\'s Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom\\'s true identities to the Phelps family.\\nJim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim.\\nJim tells Huck that Huck\\'s father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to st Petersburg.\\nHuck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally\\'s plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.\\n',\n",

various Knights Templar, most notable of whom is Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Ivanhoe\\'s main rival; a number of clergymen; the loyal serfs: Gurth the swineherd and the jester Wamba, whose observations punctuate much of the action; and the Jewish moneylender, Isaac of York, who is equally passionate about his people and his beautiful daughter, Rebecca.\\nThe book was written and published during a period of increasing struggle for the emancipation of the Jews in England, and there are frequent references to injustices against them.\\nProtagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena, Cedric\\'s ward and a descendant of the Saxon Kings of England, after Cedric planned to marry her to the powerful Lord Athelstane, a pretender to the Crown of England through his descent from the last Saxon King, Harold Godwinson.\\nIvanhoe accompanies King Richard on the Crusades, where he is said to have played a notable role in the Siege of Acre; and tends to Louis of Thuringia, who suffers from malaria.\\nThe book opens with a scene of Norman knights and prelates seeking the hospitality of Cedric.\\nThey are guided there by a pilgrim, known at that time as a palmer, (one who carried blessed palms leaves such as those that were scattered at the feet of Jesus Christ by residents of Jerusalem when he entered seated on an donkey\\'s colt on the Sunday before his arrest, trial and crucifixion; hence the name Palm Sunday).\\nAlso returning from the Holy Land that same night, Isaac of York, a Jewish moneylender, seeks refuge at Rotherwood.\\nFollowing the night\\'s meal, the palmer observes one of the Normans, the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, issue orders to his Saracen soldiers to capture Isaac.\\nThe palmer then assists in Isaac\\'s escape from Rotherwood, with the additional aid of the swineherd Gurth.\\nIsaac of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer with a suit of armour and a war horse to participate in the tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch Castle, on his inference that the palmer was secretly a knight.\\nThe palmer is taken by surprise;

Piro\\'s.\\nWhen Tsubasa suddenly departs for America to seek his \"first true love\", the protagonists are forced out of the apartment.\\nTsubasa leaves Ping, a robot girl PlayStation 2 accessory, in their care.\\nThis leads to old friends of Piro and Largo showing up later.\\nThe two are shadow operatives for video game companies, Ed (Sony) and Dom (SEGA).\\nAt one point, Piro, confronted with girl troubles, visits the local bookstore to \"research\"â\\x80\\x94look in the vast shelves of shoujo manga for a solution to his problem.\\nA spunky schoolgirl, Sonoda Yuki, and her friends, Asako and Mami, see him sitting amidst piles of read manga, and ask him what he is doing.\\nPiro, flustered, runs away, accidentally leaving behind his bookbag and sketchbook.\\nAfter their eviction, Piro begins work at \"Megagamers\", a store specializing in anime, manga, and video games.\\nHis employer allows him and Largo to live in the apartment above the store.\\nLargo is mistaken for the new English teacher at a local school, where he takes on the alias \"Great Teacher Largo\" and instructs his students in L33t, video games, and about computers.\\nYuki\\'s father, Inspector Sonada Masamichi of the \"Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division\" (TPCD) hires Largo after Largo manipulates Ping into stopping a rampaging monster, the drunken turtle Gameru.\\nAs Largo is working at the local high school, Piro encounters Yuki again while working at Megagamers, when she returns his bookbag and sketchbook, scribbled all over with comments about his drawings.\\nShe then, to his consternation, asks if he would give her drawing lessons.\\nPiro, flustered, agrees, and promptly forgets about them.\\nEarlier in the story, Piro had seen Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller\\'s restaurant, where she is a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there.\\nLater on, Piro encounters Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard.\\nPiro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer.\\nThis event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered the next time they meet.\\nDespite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them.\\nLater on in the story, Kimiko\\'s outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status.\\nAngered by the hosts\\' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration.\\nLater, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt.\\nPiro works undercover as a busboy to get rid of all cameras.\\nThe scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs.\\nPiro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos.\\nOn the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.\\nMeanwhile, Largo develops a relationship with Hayasaka Erika, Piro\\'s coworker at Megagamers.\\nShe and Kimiko share a house.\\nAs with Piro and Kimiko, Largo and Erika meet by coincidence early in the story.\\nLater, it is revealed that Erika is a former pop idol, who caused a big scene then disappeared from the public eye after her fiancÃ© left her.\\nWhen she is rediscovered by her fans, Largo helps thwart a fanboy horde, but not well enough to escape being dismissed by the TPCD for it.\\nHe then offers to help Erika to deal with her \"vulnerabilities in the digital plane\".\\nErika insists on protecting herself, so Largo instructs her in computer-building.\\nThis leads into a little more relationship than Largo can handle, partly because he insists all computer building be done in the nude or as close to it as possible, to avoid static electrical discharge ruining components, and partly because his behavior, crude though it may appear, impresses Erika in many ways.\\nThe enigmatic Tohya Miho frequently meddles in the lives of the protagonists.\\nMiho knows Piro and Largo from the Endgames MMORPG previous to Megatokyo\\'s plot.\\nShe abused a hidden statistic in the game to gain control of nearly all of the game\\'s player characters, but was ultimately defeated by Piro and Largo.\\nIn the comic, Miho becomes close friends with Ping, influencing Ping\\'s relationship with Piro and pitting Ping against Largo in video game battles.\\nMiho is also involved in Erika\\'s backstory; Miho manipulated Erika\\'s fans after Erika\\'s disappearance.\\nThis effort ended badly, leaving Miho hospitalized, and the TPCD cleaning up the aftermath.\\nMost of the exact details of what happened are left to the readers\\' imagination, as are her current motivations and ultimate goal.\\nMiho and many of the events surrounding her involve a club in Harajuku, the Cave of Evil (CoE).\\nAfter getting yelled at for retaining her waitress job, Kimiko quits her voice acting job and goes home to find Erika assembling a new computer in her undergarments.\\nNot long after Erika tells Kimiko to strip, Piro comes by, who she tells to get undressed as well.\\nWhile Erika and Piro talk about her, Kimiko, who hid when Piro showed up, runs out of the apartment.\\nKimiko runs into Ping, who wanted to talk to Piro about why, after an explosion at school, she had started to cry uncontrollably.\\nThey encounter Largo at the store, who explains what went wrong, although no one knows what he means until Piro comes in and translates.\\nPing is relieved to know that she won\\'t shut down and Kimiko hugs Piro and apologizes for her actions.\\nLargo leaves for Erika\\'s apartment after she calls looking for help.\\nThat night, while Piro and Kimiko fall asleep watching TV, Erika, who finished the computer with Largo\\'s help, tries to seduce Largo, but it freaks him out and he runs out for home.\\nThe next morning, after Kimiko departs, Piro finds out she quit her voice acting job and tries to find her.\\nKimiko and Miho are in the same diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has disrupted his attempts to destroy Ping.\\nMiho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika.\\nDom is also there to talk with Kimiko.\\nAfter rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things.\\nMiho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area.\\nDom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses.\\nDrained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone.\\nPiro then encounters a group who found Kimiko\\'s cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner.\\nThe group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko\\'s skirt.\\nPiro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, Sight.\\nBesides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area.\\nMiho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.\\nLargo and Yuki, who has since been revealed along the way to be a magical girl like her mother Meimi (likewise revealed), steal a Rent-a-Zilla to fight the zombie outbreak.\\nLargo leaves Yuki to help Piro get to Kimiko.\\nUnfortunately, the Rent-a-Zilla gets bitten by zombies and turns into one itself, resulting in the TPCD capturing it.\\nYuki protects it from the TPCD, teleports it out of the area, and adopts it as a pet in a miniaturized form, all much to her father\\'s chagrin.\\nAfter the event, Erika, Largo, Kimiko and Piro are reunited, and they talk a bit with Miho, who has shown up again after storming out following an argument with Kenji earlier.\\nMiho declines an offer to eat with the group and wanders off thinking about games and Largo and Piro.\\nShe is shown walking amongst the zombies and then in Ed\\'s gun-sights, and in the center of an attack by a number of Ed\\'s Kill-Bots.\\nDuring the next nine days, Piro and Kimiko have made up and Kimiko returned to both of her jobs, with them seeing little of each other.\\nLargo and Erika are shown to likewise be involved but more often, including going to dinner with the Sonoda family, as the inspector\\'s brother was Erika\\'s fiancÃ©.\\nKimiko is attempting to get Piro working as an artist on Sight, which unbeknownst to them is now being funded by Dom.\\nPing is concerned about the whereabouts of Miho, who hasn\\'t been seen during the time, but Piro is still upset about all that has happened and somewhat evasively refuses direct assistance.\\nPing and Junko, another one of Largo\\'s students, who used to be a friend of Miho, work towards finding Miho.\\nYuki and Kobayashi Yutaka then also become involved with the attempt because of this.\\nThat night, Piro and Kimiko discuss Miho and Endgames, which Yuki overhears, they unaware she is there.\\nThis leads Yuki to appropriate Piro\\'s powerless laptop and leave, believing him to still be in love with Miho and that the device might hold clues to finding her.\\nKimiko and Piro work on his portfolio for Sight and then they say goodnight and leave.\\nHe returns to his apartment, but Kimiko goes to the CoE club using a pass Miho gave her long ago in the beginning.\\nOnce at the club, Dom mockingly advises her, Yuki unknowingly whisps past her, and she unexpectedly meets up with an old friend Komugiko.\\nDuring all this, Piro has left his apartment after looking at his sketchbook and a drawing of Miho.\\nHis current location is unknown.\\nAside from Kimiko, concurrent overlapping events have led to almost every main character converging upon the club for various reasons involving Miho, or in support of others involved.\\nEd, attempting to destroy Ping, fights with Largo, as the staff of the club have maneuvered Ed and Ping into the protective radius of ex-Idol Erika.\\nYuki and Yutaka get Piro\\'s laptop powered on, she reads the old chat logs between Piro and Miho, and follows instructions from her to him.\\nGoing to a \"hidden-in-plain-sight\" hospital room, she finds Miho alive and well, although seemingly in a weakened state.\\nDuring a heated argument and Miho\\'s goading, Yuki then forcibly moves Miho to the club.\\nShortly after the arrival of the two in the center of everyone, the bulk of the denizens go into trance-like states while others are fighting or confused about what to do next.\\nMiho appears to be collapsing.\\nUpon instructions from Erika, Largo finds then uses his Largo-Phone and the club\\'s sound system to knock out power in the immediate area of the club.\\nDuring this event, Piro has gone to visit Miho at the \"hospital\" room, where he discovers that she is missing.\\nFollowing the blackout, Largo, Erika, and Miho board a train, where Miho decides to return home.\\nHowever, a large crowd has blocked her path home, apparently waiting for someone\\'s return.\\nThe next morning, Piro has been brought to jail, where he has been interrogated by police about Miho\\'s disappearance.\\nHe is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is obtained through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami \\'zilla and left in the cell.\\nPiro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment.\\nPiro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events.\\nShe explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted.\\nSince Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to \"build a \\'real\\' me\", as Miho explains it.\\nDuring the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and how crazy it was.\\nLargo and Erika, who are riding on the roof of a train in the Miyagi prefecture also call during the conversation.\\nAfter a short conversation with both Largo and Erika on the phone, and a bit more conversation with Miho, Piro instructs her to stay in the apartment until they can figure out what to do.\\nJunko and Ping are shown leaving for school, with Junko seeming taking Ed\\'s shotguns from last night with her.\\nAfter receiving a phone call from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami.\\nShe goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a \"monster\", which Yuki\\'s friends previously overheard and misunderstood.\\nRealizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him.\\nYutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night.\\nYutaka\\'s brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho.\\nHowever, Dom\\'s van is blocking the store\\'s entrance.\\nThough Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyways and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho.\\nIt is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat.\\nAt the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom\\'s van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow.\\nSeeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process.\\nYuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka.\\nMiho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and make their way to the local bath house.\\nJust before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand.\\nThe pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.\\n',\n",

the attack will succeed.\\nMireau proceeds to walk through the trenches, asking several soldiers, \"Ready to kill more Germans.\\n\" He throws a disturbed private (Fred Bell) out of the regiment for

hours.\\nIn a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on Earth, the UN has initiated a \"draft\" for colonizing the nearby planets, where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug (CAN-D) in concert with \"layouts\".\\nLayouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonists in their marginal off-world colonies, or even Earth, where global warming has progressed to the point that Antarctica is prime vacation resort territory.\\nThe illegal drug CAN-D allows people to \"share\" their experience of the \"Perky Pat\" (the name of the main female character in the simulated world) layouts.\\nThis \"sharing\" has caused a pseudo-religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug.\\nUp to the point where the novel begins, New York City-based Perky Pat (orP) Layouts, Inc, has held a monopoly on this product, as well as on the illegal trade in the drug CAN-D which makes the shared hallucinations possible.\\nThe novel opens shortly after Barney Mayerson,P.\\nLayouts\\' top precog, has received a \"draft notice\" from the UN for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on Mars.\\nMayerson is sleeping with his assistant, Roni Fugate, but remains conflicted about the divorce, which he himself initiated, from his first wife Emily, a ceramic pot artist.\\nMeanwhile, Emily\\'s second husband tries to sell her pot designs toP.\\nLayouts as possible accessories for the Perky Pat virtual worldsâ\\x80\\x94but Barney, recognizing them as Emily\\'s, rejects them out of spite.\\nMeanwhile, the UN rescues Palmer Eldritch\\'s ship from a crash on Pluto.\\nLeo Bulero, head ofP.\\nLayouts and an \"evolved\" human (meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a German \"doctor\" which are supposed to push the client \"forward\" on an evolutionary scale, and which result in gross physical, as well as mental, modifications), hears rumors that Eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the Prox system with similar properties to CAN-D, and that he plans to market it as \"Chew-Z,\" with UN approval, on off-world colonies.\\nHowever CHEW-Z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of CHEW-Z even more addictive than CAN-D has been.\\nThis would effectively destroyP.\\nLayouts.\\nBulero tries to contact Eldritch but he is quarantined at a UN hospital.\\nBoth Mayerson and Fugate have precognitions of reports that Bulero is going to be responsible for murdering Eldritch.\\nMeanwhile, Emily and her second husband sell her pottery designs to Eldritch and use the payment to undergo evolution therapy.\\nUnfortunately, Emily begins to devolve rather than evolve.\\nThis devolution results in a loss of creativity and she finds herself recreating older, less sophisticated designs from earlier work, without realizing it.\\nUnder the guise of a reporter, Bulero travels to Eldritch\\'s estate on the Moon, where Eldritch holds a press conference.\\nBulero is kidnapped and forced to take Chew-Z intravenously.\\nHe enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and Eldritch seemingly have some control.\\nAfter wrangling about business with Eldritch, Bulero travels to what appears to be Earth at some time in the not-too-distant future.\\nEvolved humans identify him as a ghost and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of Eldritch, an \"enemy of the Sol System\".\\nBulero returns to Earth and fires Mayerson because Mayerson was afraid to travel to the Moon to rescue him.\\nMayerson, in despair, accepts his UN conscription to Mars but Bulero recruits him as a double agent.\\nMayerson is to inject himself with a toxin after taking Chew-Z in a plot to deceive the UN into thinking Chew-Z is harmful and cause them to ban it.\\nOn Mars, Mayerson buys some Chew-Z from Eldritch, who appears in holographic form.\\nMayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with Emily but finds that he does not control his apparent hallucination.\\nLike Bulero, he finds himself in the future.\\nMayerson arrives in New York two years hence where he speaks with Bulero, Fugate and his future self about the death of Palmer Eldritch.\\nHe also encounters several manifestations of Eldritch, identifiable by their robotic right hand, artificial eyes, and steel teeth.\\nEldritch offers to help Mayerson become whatever he wants, but is so controlling of the CHEW-Z alternate reality that Mayerson ultimately decides he\\'d rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by Eldritch.\\nWhen a despairing Mayerson chooses death, he finds himself apparently forced into Eldritch\\'s body right at the point in the timeline where Bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at Eldritch\\'s ship.\\nIt appears that Eldritch\\'s plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in Mayerson\\'s body while allowing Mayerson himself to die in Eldritch\\'s place.\\nEldritch, meanwhile, intends to live on in Mayerson\\'s form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a Martian colonist.\\nMayerson, stuck in Eldritch\\'s body and mistaken for him, is indeed nearly killed by Bulero in the near future, but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his Chew-Z trance in the present by Bulero, who has just arrived on Mars.\\nBulero is willing to take Mayerson back to Earth but refuses to after learning that Mayerson did not inject himself with the toxin.\\nMayerson is now confident that Bulero will kill Eldritch, so the sacrifice of taking the toxin in order to ruin Eldritch\\'s business is unnecessary; but he does not try to convince Bulero of this.\\nLater, Mayerson discusses his experience with a neo-Christian colonist and they conclude that either Eldritch became a god in the Prox system or some god-like being has taken his place.\\nMayerson is convinced some aspect of Eldritch is still inside him, and that as long as he refuses to take Chew-Z again, it is Eldritch who will actually be killed by Bulero in the near future; Mayerson is half-resigned, half-hopeful about taking on the life of a Martian colonist without reprieve.\\nMayerson considers the possibility of Eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god, but inimical, or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god.\\nThe novel has an ambiguous ending, with Bulero heading back toward Earth, and apparent proliferation of Eldritch\\'s cyborg bodily \\'stigmata\\', which may mean that Bulero is still trapped in Eldritch\\'s hallucinatory domain, or that Chew-Z is becoming increasingly popular among Terrans and Martian colonists.\\n',\n",

confronted by Nessus, a Pierson\\'s Puppeteer, and offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond Known Space.\\nSpeaker-to-Animals (Speaker), who is a Kzin, and Teela Brown, a young human woman, also join the voyage.\\nThey first travel to the Puppeteer home world, where they learn that the expedition\\'s goal is to explore Ringworld, an artificial ring about one million miles (1,600,000 km) wide and approximately the diameter of Earth\\'s orbit (which makes it about 600,000,000 miles or 950,000,000 km in circumference), encircling a sunlike star.\\nIt rotates, providing artificial gravity that is 992% as strong as Earth\\'s gravity through the action of centrifugal force.\\nThe Ringworld has a habitable, flat inner surface equivalent in area to approximately three million Earth-sized planets.\\nNight is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin, ultra-strong wire (shadow-square wire).\\nNone of the crew\\'s attempts at contacting the Ringworld succeed, and their ship, the Lying Bastard, is disabled by the Ringworld\\'s automated meteoroid-defense system.\\nThe severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands on the Ringworld near a huge mountain.\\nThe ship\\'s defenses keep the crew compartment and many of the ship\\'s systems intact, including the faster-than-light drive (hyperdrive), but the normal drive is destroyed, leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive.\\nThe team now has to set out to find a way to get back into space, as well as fulfilling their original mission â\\x80\\x93 learning more about the Ringworld.\\nUsing their flycycles (similar to antigravity motorcycles), they try to reach the rim of the

becoming too absorbed in watching the vast landscape ahead, they find themselves forced to land.\\nOn the ground, they encounter apparently human Ringworld natives.\\nThe natives, who are living primitively in the crumbling ruins of a once advanced city, think that the crew are the Engineers of the Ring, whom they revere as gods.\\nThe crew is attacked when they commit what the natives consider blasphemy (the misuse of certain technologies).\\nThey continue their journey during which Nessus is forced to reveal some Puppeteer secrets: they have performed indirect breeding experiments on both humans (breeding for luck) and kzin (breeding for less aggressiveness).\\nThe resulting hostility forces Nessus to abandon the other three and follow them at a safe distance.\\nThey encounter a city and, in a floating building, they find a map of the Ringworld and videos of its past civilization.\\nIn a giant storm, caused by air escaping through a hole in the Ring floor due to meteoroid impact, Teela is blown away in an unknown direction.\\nWhile Louis and Speaker search for her in a ruined city, their flycycles are caught by an automatic police station designed to catch traffic offenders.\\nThey are trapped in a prison in the basement of the police station.\\nNessus arrives, entering the station to help his team.\\nIn the station they meet Halrloprillalar Hotrufan

relates what she learned of the downfall of the Ringworld\\'s civilization: A mold that breaks down superconductors was introduced by a visiting spaceship.\\nWithout its superconductive technology, civilization fell.\\nTeela reaches the police station, accompanied by her new lover, a native \"hero\" called Seeker who helped her survive.\\nBased on his studies of an ancient Ringworld map, Louis devises a plan to escape.\\nThe four explorers, with Seeker and Prill, use the floating police station as a vehicle to travel back to the explorers\\' crashed ship.\\nTeela and Seeker choose to remain on Ringworld.\\nThe remaining explorers and Prill collect one end of the shadow-square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed, dragging the wire behind them as they travel.\\nReaching the wreck, Louis threads the wire through the ship and uses it to tether the ship to the police station.\\nStill in the station, he then continues to pull the wire onward, up to the summit of \"Fist-of-God\", the enormous mountain near their crash site.\\nThe massive mountain had not appeared on a map of the original Ringworld, leading Louis to conclude that it was in fact the result of a meteoroid impact with the underside of the ring, which pushed the \"mountain\" up from the ring floor and broke through.\\nThe top of the mountain, above the edge of the ring\\'s atmosphere, is therefore a passage to the underside of the Ringworld and freedom.\\nLouis drives the police station over the edge of the crater.\\nThe Ringworld spins very quickly, so once the police station and ship are free of the ring, their speed is enough to get them back to open space in a reasonable time.\\nThe crew can then use the ship\\'s hyperdrive to get home.\\nThe book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.\\n',\n",

orbit of Jupiter.\\nIts speed (100,000&nbsp;km/h) and the angle of its trajectory clearly indicate it is not on a long orbit around the sun, but comes from interstellar space.\\nThe astronomers\\' interest is further piqued when they realise the asteroid has an extremely rapid rotation period of 4 minutes and is exceptionally large.\\nIt is named Rama after the Hindu god, and an unmanned space probe dubbed Sita is launched from the Mars moon Phobos to intercept and photograph it.\\nThe resulting images reveal that Rama is a perfect cylinder, in diameter and long, and completely featureless, making this humankind\\'s first encounter with an alien spacecraft.\\nThe manned solar survey vessel Endeavour is sent to study Rama, as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period Rama will spend in our solar system.\\nEndeavour manages to rendezvous with Rama one month after it first comes to Earth\\'s attention, when the alien ship is already inside Venus\\' orbit.\\nThe 20+ crew, led by Commander Bill Norton, enters Rama through a dual safety system consisting of two sets of triple airlocks, six in all, and explores the vast 16-km wide by 50-km long cylindrical world of its interior, but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remain enigmatic throughout the book.\\nThe astronauts discover that Rama is hollow, and that its inner surfaces hold vast \"cities\" of geometric structures that resemble buildings and are separated by streets with shallow trenches.\\nA mammoth band of water, dubbed the Cylindrical Sea, stretches around Rama\\'s central circumference.\\nMassive cones, which the astronauts theorise are part of Rama\\'s propulsion system, stand at its \\'southern\\' end.\\nThey also find that Rama\\'s atmosphere is breathable.\\nOne of

ignores him.\\nPak explores the surrounding fields while waiting for the rescue party to arrive on the southern cliffs of the cylindrical sea.\\nAmongst the strange geometric structures, he sees an alien flower growing through a cracked tile in the otherwise sterile environment, and decides to take it as both a curiosity and for scientific research.\\nPak jumps off the 500 m cliff, his descent slowed by the low gravity and using his shirt as a parachute, and is quickly rescued by the waiting boat.\\nAs they ride back, tidal waves form in the cylindrical sea, created by the movements of Rama itself as it makes course corrections.\\nWhen the crew arrives at base, they see a variety of odd creatures inspecting their camp.\\nWhen one is found damaged and apparently lifeless, the team\\'s doctor/biologist Surgeon-Commander Laura Ernst inspects it, and discovers it to be a hybrid biological entity and robotâ\\x80\\x94eventually termed a \"biot\".\\nIt, and by assumption the others, are powered by natural internal batteries (much like those of terrestrial electric eels) and possess some intelligence.\\nThey are believed to be the drones of Rama\\'s still-absent builders.\\nThe members of the Rama Committee and the United Planets, both based on the moon, have been monitoring events inside Rama and giving feedback.\\nThe Hermian colonists have concluded that Rama is a potential threat and send a rocket-mounted nuclear bomb to destroy it should it prove to pose a threat, but lt Boris Rodrigo uses a pair of wire cutters to defuse the bomb and its control.\\nAs Rama approaches perihelion, the biots jump into the cylindrical sea, where they are destroyed (or recycled) by aquatic biots (\\'sharks\\') and reabsorbed into the mineral-laden water.\\nOn their final expedition, some crew members decide to visit the city christened \"London\" (as it is closest to Rama\\'s \"northern\" end, the point of their entry), where they use a laser to cut open one of the \"buildings\" to see what it houses.\\nThey discover transparent pedestals containing holograms of various artefacts, which they theorise are used by the Ramans as templates for creating tools and other objects.\\nThe most amazing of these appears to be a uniform with bandoliers, straps and pockets that suggests the size and shape of the Ramans.\\nAs the crew photographs some of the holograms, the six gigantic striplights that illuminate Rama\\'s interior start to dim, prompting the explorers to leave and re-board Endeavour.\\nWith Endeavour a safe distance away, Rama reaches perihelion and utilizes the Sun\\'s gravitational field, and its mysterious \"space drive\", to perform a slingshot manoeuvre which flings it out of the solar system and towards an unknown destination in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud.\\nThe book was meant to stand alone, although its final sentence suggests otherwise:  Clarke denied that this sentence was a hint that the story might be

is preparing to launch an attack on London.\\nHe intends to use a V-2 rocket fitted with an experimental biological warhead, launching it from his base near Katamarunde in the Baltics.\\nDue to the stealthy nature in which the OSA needs to act, Blazkowicz is parachuted some distance from the missile base and separated from his equipment.\\nAfter collecting his gear, he smuggles himself into a supply truck bound for the base.\\nOnce inside, Blazkowicz destroys the V-2 on its launchpad and fights his way out of the facility towards an airbase filled with experimental jet aircraft.\\nThere, he commandeers a \"Kobra\" rocket-plane and flies to safety in Malta.\\nEager to know more about Deathshead and his secret projects, the OSA sends Blazkowicz to the bombed-out city of Kugelstadt, where he is assisted by members of the German Kreisau Circle resistance group in breaking into a ruined factory and exfiltrating a defecting scientist.\\nIt is there he discovers the blueprints for the Reich\\'s latest weapon, the Venom Gun, an electrically operated hand-held minigun.\\nHe also procures the weapon itself.\\nBlazkowicz eventually breaks into Deathshead\\'s underground research complex, the Secret Weapons Facility.\\nThere he encounters the horrific fruits of Deathshead\\'s labors: creatures, malformed, and twisted through surgery and mechanical implants.\\nThe creatures escape from their containments and go on a rampage.\\nBlazkowicz fights his way through the facility, only to see Deathshead escape the chaos by U-Boat, and learns of his destination by interrogating a captured German officer.\\nBlazkowicz, with his newly found information, is then parachuted into Norway, close to Deathshead\\'s mysterious \"X-Labs\".\\nAfter breaking into the facility, which has been overrun by the twisted creatures he encountered in Kugelstadt (dubbed \\'Lopers\\'), Blazkowicz retrieves Deathshead\\'s journal, its content directly linking Deathshead\\'s research to the rest of the SS Paranormal\\'s occult activity.\\nHe then confronts several new prototype creatures called Ã\\x9cbersoldaten (super soldiers), towering monstrosities coated in armor, powered by hydraulic legs and carrying powerful weapons.\\nFinally catching up with Deathshead, Blazkowicz comes face to face with a completed and fully armored Ã\\x9cbersoldat, and kills the researchers who have developed it.\\nAfter the Ã\\x9cbersoldat is destroyed, Deathshead shouts over the speakers in frustration and astonishment before escaping in a Kobra rocket-plane and disappears for the rest of the game.\\nAfter studying the documents captured by Blazkowicz, the OSA has become aware of a scheme codenamed \\'Operation: Resurrection\\', a plan to resurrect Heinrich I, a legendary and powerful Saxon warlock-king from 943 AD.\\nDespite the skepticism of senior Allied commanders, the OSA parachutes Blazkowicz back near Castle Wolfenstein, at the Bramburg Dam, where he fights his way until he arrives at the village town of Paderborn.\\nAfter assassinating all the senior officers of the SS Paranormal Division present there for the resurrection, Blazkowicz fights his way through Chateau Schufstaffel and into the grounds beyond.\\nAfter fighting two more Ã\\x9cbersoldaten, Blazkowicz enters an excavation site near Castle Wolfenstein.\\nInside the excavation site, Blazkowicz fights Nazi guards and prototype Ã\\x9cbersoldaten, and makes his way to a boarded-up entrance to Castle Wolfenstein\\'s underground crypts.\\nThere, he finds that the ruined and decaying sections of the castle has become infested with undead creatures, which are attacking the castle\\'s desperate garrison.\\nAfter fighting his way through the underworkings of the castle, Blazkowicz arrives too late at the site of a dark ceremony to prevent the resurrection of Heinrich At the ceremony, SS psychic and OberfÃ¼hrerin Marianna Blavatsky conjures up dark spirits, which transform three of Deathshead\\'s Ã\\x9cbersoldaten into Dark Knights, Heinrich\\'s lieutenants.\\nShe ultimately raises Heinrich I, who \"thanks\" her by turning her into his undead slave.\\nIn a climactic battle, Blazkowicz, after exhausting most of his arsenal, destroys the three Dark Knights, the undead Marianna Blavatsky, and eventually Heinrich In the distance, ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS Heinrich Himmler watches in horror, remarking afterwards \"This American.\\nhe has ruined everything\" as he leaves for Berlin to face an expectant Hitler.\\nBack in the OSA, Operation Resurrection is closed and Blazkowicz is off on some \"R&R\" â\\x80\\x94 shooting Nazis.\\n',\n",

about to embark on a raid against a colony inhabited by \"Skinnies\" (allies of the Arachnids).\\nRico himself is a \\'cap [capsule] trooper\\' in the Terran Federation\\'s Mobile Infantry.\\nThe raid itself is relatively brief: the Roughnecks land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, suffering two casualties in the process (one, Dizzy Flores, dies during the return to orbit).\\nThe story then flashes back to Rico\\'s graduation from high school, where the reader sees his close relationship with his best friend Carl and their decision to sign up for Federal Service together over the objections of Rico\\'s father.\\nThis is the only chapter that describes Rico\\'s civilian life, and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lieutenant Colonel Jean Dubois, Rico\\'s school instructor in \"History and Moral Philosophy\"; and Fleet Sergeant Ho, a disabled recruiter for the armed forces.\\nDubois elucidates the book\\'s moral position in matters of war; whereas Fleet Sergeant Ho\\'s monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades seem primarily in contrast with Dubois.\\nLater it becomes apparent that his attitude and display of truncated limbs are intended to scare off unmotivated applicants.\\nInterspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico\\'s History and Moral Philosophy course, which reveal that the rights of a full Citizen (to vote and hold public office) must be earned through voluntary Federal service.\\nThose who do not perform this Service retain the rights of free speech, assembly, etc, but cannot vote or hold public office.\\nThis structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the \"20th century Western democracies\", brought on by social failures at home (among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency) and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas.\\nIn the next section of the novel, Rico begins training at Camp Arthur Currie on the Canadian prairie.\\nFive chapters are spent exploring Rico\\'s experience there, under the tutelage of career Ship\\'s Sergeant Charles Zim.\\nFewer than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training; the rest resign, are expelled, or die in training.\\nOne of the chapters displays Ted Hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant complainer, who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer (Sergeant Zim) during a simulated combat exercise.\\nZim does not offer this information to his superior, but Hendrick does.\\nAnother recruit, a deserter who murdered a baby girl while AWOL, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police.\\nRico himself is flogged for negligent handling of his equipment during a simulated nuclear weapons drill.\\nDespite this punishment and his own earlier doubts about his fitness to serve, Rico eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit in the Fleet.\\nDuring Rico\\'s training, the \"Bug War\" has changed from border incidents to a full-scale war, and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations.\\nThe war \"officially\" starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires (which kills Rico\\'s mother).\\nRico briefly describes the Terran Federation\\'s disastrous defeat at the Battle of Klendathu, during which his first unit and ship are destroyed.\\nFollowing Klendathu, the Terran Federation is reduced to hit-and-run raids similar to that described at the beginning of the novel.\\nThis part of the book describes the daily routine of military life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned officers (personified in this case by Lieutenant Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal).\\nEventually, Rico becomes a career soldier, and one of his fellow troopers recommends him to Officer Candidate School, where he undergoes a second course of training.\\nEn route from the Roughnecks to OCS, Sergeant Rico encounters his estranged father, now Corporal Rico, in transit, and reconciles with him.\\nSergeant Rico is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his final test: a posting to a combat unit.\\nUnder the tutelage of his company commander, Captain Blackstone, and with the aid of his platoon sergeant, Zim (reassigned from Camp Arthur Currie), Rico commands a platoon during \\'Operation Royalty\\': a raid to capture members of the Bugs\\' \\'brain caste\\' and \\'queens\\', and graduates as a second lieutenant.\\nThe final chapter serves as a coda, depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the commander of Rico\\'s Roughnecks (previously Rasczak\\'s Roughnecks), preparing to invade Klendathu, with his father as senior NCO.\\n',\n",

              " 198: 'Based on the ideas in the book Future Shock by Alvin Toffler, the novel shows a dystopian early 21st century America dominated by computer networks, and is considered by some critics to be an early ancestor of the \"cyberpunk\" genre.\\nThe hero, Nick Haflinger, is a runaway from Tarnover, a government program intended to find, educate and indoctrinate highly gifted children to further the interests of the state in a future where quantitative analysis backed by the tacit threat of coercion has replaced overt military and economic power as the deciding factor in international competition.\\nIn parallel with this, the government has become a de facto oligarchy whose beneficiaries are members of organised crime.\\nNick\\'s talent extends to programming the network using only a touch tone telephone.\\nOne of his handlers at Tarnover explains that this is like a classical pianist being able to play entire sonatas and concertos from memory.\\nHowever Nick also has some personality flaws, amounting almost to a deathwish.\\nThese become manifest in exhibitions of his abilities, revealing his identity to his pursuers.\\nThe background to the story includes a massive earthquake laying waste to the San Francisco Bay Area in California.\\nMillions die and millions more are left to live on government handouts.\\nThe subsequent economic depression, coupled with the rootlessness enabled by access to online data and strong social pressure to be flexible (the results of corporations wanting highly mobile workforces without strong local ties), results in a fragmentation of society along religious, ethnic and a variety of class markers, what Toffler calls \"subcults\", including what would in 2010 be described as \"gangs\".\\nThe equitable distribution of data access and data privacy is a prominent theme in the book; characters who have access to information which is nominally secret enjoy demonstrable economic advantages over others lacking access to such data.\\nIn the novel, data privacy is reserved for corporate entities and individuals who may then conceal wrongdoing; by contrast, normal citizens do not enjoy significant privacy.\\nThe world described in the book is dystopian, with laissez-faire economics portrayed as leading inevitably to disaster as greed trumps long-term planning.\\nThe educational system is dysfunctional, with teachers unable to perform their jobs due to strictures.\\nThe only \\'functional\\' educational system seen in the book is portrayed as an enclave, the tightly-controlled Tarnover school.\\nCommunities are either walled enclaves of privilege or largely lawless areas entirely lacking protection from corrupt civil authorities.\\nInfrastructure has been allowed to crumble, and characters who reside within \\'paid avoidance zones\\' receive compensation from the government in lieu of actual services.\\nThe novel is set in the weeks following Nick\\'s recapture after several years on the run, alternating between moral arguments with his interrogator, who is trying to discover why the program\\'s star pupil had absconded, and flashbacks of his career.\\nThe interrogator is Paul Freeman, a graduate of another secret installation known as \"Electric Skillet\", which focuses on weapons and defence strategy.\\nAlthough he had initially felt at home at Tarnover, Nick eventually becomes aware of experiments in genetic engineering being performed there.\\nThese produce monstrous deformed children who are disposed of when they are no longer needed for study.\\nAt this point Nick becomes determined to escape.\\nHe studies data processing, steals a personal ID code intended for privileged individuals who wish to live their lives without surveillance, and goes on the run.\\nHe uses the stolen computer access code to cover his data trails and create new identities for himself, easily adopting entire new personas.\\nOne is the pastor of a popular church, another is a successful computer consultant.\\nIn this last role, calling himself Sandy Locke, he becomes the lover of Ina Grierson, a top executive at Ground to Space Industries, a powerful \"hypercorp\" known to all as G2S.\\nIntending to use the computer facilities at G2S to ensure that his stolen code is still valid, he signs on as a \"systems rationalizer\" with the company.\\nThis brings him into contact with Ina\\'s daughter, Kate, who attracts him despite her plain appearance and simple lifestyle.\\nAt the age of 22, Nick\\'s age when he left Tarnover, Kate is a perpetual student at \"UMKC\".\\nShe is perceptive enough to penetrate Nick\\'s adopted persona, deeply disturbing him even though she fascinates him.\\nHe visits her at home, helping her to clean out some of her possessions, and meeting her tame cougar, Bagheera.\\nBagheera is the product of her late father\\'s genetic research into intelligence.\\nHe died shortly after abandoning the research because the government was using it to produce animals for military uses.\\nThe 21st-century lifestyle produces a symptom called \"overload\" in many people, and most, including Nick, take tranquilizers to some degree.\\nHowever Nick collapses completely when told that a representative from Tarnover is coming to meet him at G2S.\\nHe returns to Kate and confesses that he is not what he seems, asking for her help.\\nShe conducts him to one of the \"paid avoidance areas\" in California, where people are paid to do without the full panoply of modern technology, as an alternative to spending billions to rebuild infrastructure after the earthquake.\\nAfter Nick risks exposure yet again in one of these places, they move to the least known one, a town called Precipice.\\nPrecipice turns out to be a Utopian community of a few thousand people.\\nThe nearest comparison would be an agrarian, cottage industry community designed by William Morris.\\nPrecipice is also the home of \"Hearing Aid\", an anonymous telephone confession service accessible to anyone in the country.\\nHearing Aid is also known as the \"Ten Nines\", after the phone number used to call it: 999-999-9999.\\nPeople call the service, a human operator answers, and they simply talk while the operator listens.\\nSome rant, others seek sympathy, still others commit suicide while on the phone.\\nHearing Aid\\'s promise is that nobody else, not even the government, will hear the call.\\nThe only response Hearing Aid gives to a caller is \"Only I heard that, I hope it helped\".\\nNick and Kate settle into the community.\\nThe inhabitants include intelligent dogs that escaped from the projects that Kate\\'s father worked on.\\nThese act as companions, guards, nannies, and even lie detectors, using their sense of smell.\\nNick rewrites the \"computer tapeworm\" that prevents the calls to Hearing Aid being monitored.\\nWhile at G2S he became aware of massive backups of data being performed, clearly in anticipation of a major network outage.\\nThe Hearing Aid worm is designed to scramble network traffic if attacked, but Nick realises that it could be destroyed if the authorities were prepared for the effects and ready to recover from them.\\nHis new worm, which he calls a \"phage\", cannot be removed without dismantling the entire network.\\nPossibly encouraged by the government, local gangs and tribes raid Precipice, burning down Nick and Kate\\'s house before being overwhelmed by the dogs.\\nNick, suffering another overload, blames Kate for the incident, since she, following Hearing Aid policy, cut off a call from someone attempting to warn Precipice.\\nHe hits her, and then, filled with remorse, leaves the town.\\nHe finally reveals his location to the authorities when, encountering one of the \"Roman circus\" operations which broadcast live fights and other bloody exhibitions to the country, he responds to an \"all comers\" challenge by the father of the leader of one of the gangs, and cripples him in front of a nationwide audience.\\nAt Tarnover, Paul Freeman takes charge of the interrogation.\\nHe was the representative whom Nick, as Sandy Locke, was supposed to meet at G2S.\\nFreeman, a tall gaunt African-American, gradually comes to realise that he has more sympathy with Nick\\'s views than his employer\\'s, and eventually absconds himself, giving Nick computer access so that Nick can make his own escape.\\nThe precipitating event in this case is Kate\\'s abduction by government agents, who bring her to Tarnover for further questioning and to threaten Nick.\\nWith the code he gets from Freeman, he sets up an identity as an Army major, with Kate as his prisoner.\\nOnce clear of Tarnover, they disappear together.\\nThis time around, Nick has another plan, and rather than running and hiding, he and Kate spend a number of months travelling the country, aided by an \"invisible college\" of academics who are allies or former residents of Precipice.\\nHe creates a new \"worm\" which is designed to destroy all secrecy.\\n(Brunner invented the term \"worm\" for this program, as a self-replicating program that propagates across a computer network â\\x80\\x93 the term \"worm\" was later adopted by computer researchers as the name for this type of program)  The worm is eventually activated, and the details of all the government\\'s dark secrets (clandestine genetic experimentation that produces crippled children, bribes and kickbacks from corporations, concealed crimes of high public officials) now become accessible from anywhere on the network â\\x80\\x93 in fact, those most affected by a particular crime of a government official are emailed the full details.\\nIn place of the old system, Nick has designed the worm to enforce a kind of utilitarian socialism, with people\\'s worth being defined by their roles in society, not their connections in high places.\\nIn effect, the network becomes the entire government and financial system, policing income for illegal money, freezing the accounts of criminals, while making sure money (or credit) flows to places where people are in need.\\nThis will only happen fully if the results of a plebiscite, again conducted over the network, allow it.\\nIn a final atavistic attempt at revenge, the government orders a nuclear strike by a single aircraft from a local Air Force base.\\nWarned by Hearing Aid, Nick is able to penetrate the military computers and manufacture a counter-order to stop the plane just before it reaches the town.\\nThe book ends optimistically, with there being no more privileged hiding of information, no more secret conspiracies of the rich and powerful.\\n',\n",

              " 203: 'The A-Team is a naturally episodic show, with few overarching stories, except the characters\\' continuing motivation to clear their names, with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure.\\nIn describing the ratings drop that occurred during the show\\'s fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity \"because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome\".\\nSimilarly, reporter Adrian Lee called the plots \"stunningly simple\" in a 2006 article for The Express (UK newspaper), citing such recurring elements \"as BA\\'s fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items\".\\nThe show became emblematic of this kind of \"fit-for-TV warfare\" due to its depiction of high-octane combat scenes, with lethal weapons, wherein the participants (with the notable exception of General Fulbright) are never killed and rarely seriously injured (see also On-screen violence section).\\nAs the television ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show\\'s final season in 1986â\\x80\\x9387 in a bid to win back viewers.\\nAfter years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military.\\nGeneral Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions.\\nIn order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity.\\nWith the help of a new character, Frankie \"Dishpan Man\" Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad.\\nThe new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast.\\nThe missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of , and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands.\\nThese changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline.\\nOnly 13 episodes aired in the fifth season.\\nIn what was supposed to be the final episode, \"The Grey Team\" (although \"Without Reservations\" was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him.\\nAt the end, the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team.\\nThe character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, \"fini\".\\nDuring the Vietnam War, the A-Team were members of the 5th Special Forces Group (see episode \"West Coast Turnaround\").\\nIn episode \"Bad Time on the Border\", Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith, portrayed by George Peppard, indicated that the A-Team were \"ex-Green Berets\".\\nDuring the Vietnam War, the A-Team\\'s commanding officer, Colonel Morrison, gave them orders to rob the Bank of Hanoi to help bring the war to an end.\\nThey succeeded in their mission, but on their return to base four days after the end of the war, they discovered that Morrison had been killed by the Viet Cong, and that his headquarters had been burned to the ground.\\nThis meant that the proof that the A-Team members were acting under orders had been destroyed.\\nThey were arrested, and imprisoned at Fort Bragg, from which they quickly escaped before standing trial.\\nThe origin of the A-Team is directly linked to the Vietnam War, during which the team formed.\\nThe show\\'s introduction in the first four seasons mentions this, accompanied by images of soldiers coming out of a helicopter in an area resembling a forest or jungle.\\nBesides this, The A-Team would occasionally feature an episode in which the team came across an old ally or enemy from those war days.\\nFor example, the first season\\'s final episode \"A Nice Place To Visit\" revolved around the team traveling to a small town to honor a fallen comrade and end up avenging his death, and in season two\\'s \"Recipe For Heavy Bread\", a chance encounter leads the team to meet both the POW cook who helped them during the war, and the American officer who sold his unit out.\\nAn article in the New Statesman (UK) published shortly after the premiere of The A-Team in the United Kingdom, also pointed out The A-Team\\'s connection to the Vietnam War, characterizing it as the representation of the idealization of the Vietnam War, and an example of the war slowly becoming accepted and assimilated into American culture.\\nOne of the team\\'s primary antagonists, Col.\\nRoderick Decker (Lance LeGault), had his past linked back to the Vietnam War, in which he and Hannibal had come to fisticuffs in \"the DOOM Club\" (Da Nang Open Officers\\' Mess).\\nAt other times, members of the team would refer back to a certain tactic used during the War, which would be relevant to the team\\'s present predicament.\\nOften, Hannibal would refer to such a tactic, after which the other members of the team would complain about its failure during the War.\\nThis was also used to refer to some of Face\\'s past accomplishments in scamming items for the team, such as in the first-season episode \"Holiday In The Hills\", in which Murdock fondly remembers Face being able to secure a \\'53 Cadillac while in the Vietnam jungle.\\nThe team\\'s ties to the Vietnam War were referenced again in the fourth-season finale, \"The Sound of Thunder\", in which the team is introduced to Tia (Tia Carrere), a war orphan and daughter of fourth season antagonist General Fulbright.\\nReturning to Vietnam, Fulbright is shot in the back and gives his last words as he dies.\\nThe 2006 documentary Bring Back The A-Team joked that the scene lasted seven and a half minutes, but his death actually took a little over a minute.\\nHis murderer, a Vietnamese colonel, is killed in retaliation.\\nTia then returns with the team to the United States (see also: casting).\\nThis episode is notable for having one of the show\\'s few truly serious dramatic moments, with each team member privately reminiscing on their war experiences, intercut with news footage from the war with Barry McGuire\\'s Eve of Destruction playing in the background.\\nThe show\\'s ties to the Vietnam War are fully dealt with in the opening arc of the fifth season, dubbed \"The Court-Martial (Part 1â\\x80\\x933)\", in which the team is finally court-martialed for the robbery of the bank of Hanoi.\\nThe character of Roderick Decker makes a return on the witness stand, and various newly introduced characters from the A-Team\\'s past also make appearances.\\nThe team, after a string of setbacks, decides to plead guilty to the crime and they are sentenced to be executed.\\nThey escape this fate and come to work for a General Hunt Stockwell, leading into the remainder of the fifth season.\\n',\n",

Humperdinck later tells Buttercup he has let Westley return to his ship, but in reality Rugen and the Albino (Mel Smith) are torturing Westley in a secret laboratory called the Pit of Despair, using a torture machine to drain the life from him.\\nWhen Buttercup tells Humperdinck that he is a coward and that she still loves Westley, Humperdinck locks her in a suite, rushes to the Pit and, ignoring Rugen\\'s warning, engages the machine at its highest setting, sending a screaming Westley to his death.\\nFezzik, having reunited with a drunk Inigo in a nearby village, has learned that Rugen is the six-fingered man Inigo seeks, but, with the castle secured for Humperdinck\\'s wedding, believes they need the Man in Black\\'s (Westley\\'s) help to invade;

she was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, who played a key role in the English Reformation in the 1520s.\\nShe had been brought up by Blanche Herbert Lady Troy.\\nAt her coronation in January 1559, many of the bishops â\\x80\\x93 Catholic, appointed by Mary, who had expelled many of the Protestant clergymen when she became queen in 1553 â\\x80\\x93 refused to perform the service in English.\\nEventually, the relatively minor Bishop of Carlisle, Owen Oglethorpe, performed the ceremony; but when Oglethorpe attempted to perform traditional Catholic parts of the Coronation, Elizabeth got up and left.\\nFollowing the Coronation, two important Acts were passed through parliament: the Act of Uniformity and the Act of Supremacy, establishing the Protestant Church of England and creating Elizabeth Supreme Governor of the Church of England (Supreme Head, the title used by her father and brother, was seen as inappropriate for a woman ruler).\\nThese acts, known collectively as the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, made it compulsory to attend church services every Sunday; and imposed an oath on clergymen and statesmen to recognise the Church of England, the independence of the Church of England from the Catholic Church, and the authority of Elizabeth as Supreme Governor.\\nElizabeth made it clear that if they refused the oath the first time, they would have a second opportunity, after which, if the oath was not sworn, the offenders would be deprived of their offices and estates.\\nEven though Elizabeth was only twenty-five when she came to the throne, she was absolutely sure of her God-given place to be the queen and of her responsibilities as the 'handmaiden of the Lord'.\\nShe never let anyone challenge her authority as queen, even though many people, who felt she was weak and should be married, tried to do so.\\nThe popularity of Elizabeth was extremely high, but her Privy Council, her Parliament and her subjects thought that the unmarried queen should take a husband; it was generally accepted that, once a queen regnant was married, the husband would relieve the woman of the burdens of head of state.\\nAlso, without an heir, the Tudor line would end; the risk of civil war between rival claimants was a possibility if Elizabeth died childless.\\nNumerous suitors from nearly all European nations sent ambassadors to English court to put forward their suit.\\nRisk of death came dangerously close in 1564 when Elizabeth caught smallpox; when she was most at risk, she named Robert Dudley as Lord Protector in the event of her death.\\nAfter her recovery, she appointed Dudley to the Privy Council and created him Earl of Leicester, in the hope that he would marry Mary, Queen of Scots.\\nMary rejected him, and instead married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, a descendant of Henry VII, giving Mary a stronger claim to the English throne.\\nAlthough many Catholics were loyal to Elizabeth, many also believed that, because Elizabeth was declared illegitimate after her parents' marriage was annulled, Mary was the strongest legitimate claimant.\\nDespite this, Elizabeth would not name Mary her heir; as she had experienced during the reign of her predecessor Mary I, the opposition could flock around the heir if they were disheartened with Elizabeth's rule.\\nNumerous threats to the Tudor line occurred during Elizabeth's reign.\\nIn 1569, a group of Earls led by Charles Neville, the sixth Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, the seventh Earl of Northumberland attempted to depose Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots.\\nIn 1571, the Protestant-turned-Catholic Thomas Howard, the fourth Duke of Norfolk, had plans to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, and then replace Elizabeth with Mary.\\nThe plot, masterminded by Roberto di Ridolfi, was discovered and Norfolk was beheaded.\\nThe next major uprising was in 1601, when Robert Devereux, the second Earl of Essex, attempted to raise the city of London against Elizabeth's government.\\nThe city of London proved unwilling to rebel; Essex and most of his co-rebels were executed.\\nThreats also came from abroad.\\nIn 1570, Pope Pius V issued a Papal bull, Regnans in Excelsis, excommunicating Elizabeth, and releasing her subjects from their allegiance to her.\\nElizabeth came under pressure from Parliament to execute Mary, Queen of Scots, to prevent any further attempts to replace her; though faced with several official requests, she vacillated over the decision to execute an anointed queen.\\nFinally, she was persuaded of Mary's (treasonous) complicity in the plotting against her, and she signed the death warrant in 1586.\\nMary was executed at Fotheringay Castle on 8 February 1587, to the outrage of Catholic Europe.\\nThere are many reasons debated as to why Elizabeth never married.\\nIt was rumoured that she was in love with Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and that on one of her summer progresses she had birthed his illegitimate child.\\nThis rumour was just one of many that swirled around the two's long-standing friendship.\\nHowever, more important to focus on were the disasters that many women, such as Lady Jane Grey, suffered due to being married into the royal family.\\nHer sister Mary's marriage to Philip brought great contempt to the country, for many of her subjects despised Spain and Philip and feared that he would try to take complete control.\\nRecalling her father's disdain for Anne of Cleves, Elizabeth also refused to enter into a foreign match with a man that she had never seen before, so that also eliminated a large number of suitors.\\nDespite the uncertainty of Elizabeth's â\\x80\\x93 and therefore the Tudor's â\\x80\\x93 hold on England, she never married.\\nThe closest she came to marriage was between 1579 and 1581, when she was courted by Francis, Duke of Anjou, the son of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici.\\nDespite Elizabeth's government constantly begging her to marry in the early years of her reign, it was now persuading Elizabeth not to marry the French prince for his mother, Catherine de' Medici, was suspected of ordering the St Bartholomew's Day massacre of tens of thousands of French Protestant Huguenots in 1572.\\nElizabeth bowed to public feeling against the marriage, learning from the mistake her sister made when she married Philip II of Spain, and sent the Duke of Anjou away.\\nElizabeth knew that the continuation of the Tudor line was now impossible; she was forty-eight in 1581, and too old to bear children.\\nBy far the most dangerous threat to the Tudor line during Elizabeth's reign was the Spanish Armada of 1588.\\nLaunched by Elizabeth's old suitor Philip II of Spain, this was commanded by Alonso de GuzmÃ¡n El Bueno, the seventh Duke of Medina Sidonia.\\nThe Spanish invasion fleet outnumbered the English fleet's 22 galleons and 108 armed merchant ships; however, the Spanish lost as a result of bad weather on the English Channel and poor planning and logistics, and in the face of the skills of Sir Francis Drake and Charles Howard, the second Baron Howard of Effingham (later first Earl of Nottingham).\\nWhile Elizabeth declined physically with age, her running of the country continued to benefit her people.\\nIn response to famine across England due to bad harvests in the 1590s, Elizabeth introduced the poor law, allowing peasants who were too ill to work a certain amount of money from the state.\\nAll the money Elizabeth had borrowed from Parliament in 12 of the 13 parliamentary sessions was paid back; by the time of her death, Elizabeth not only had no debts, but was in credit.\\nElizabeth died childless at Richmond Palace on 24 March 1603.\\nElizabeth may not have left behind an heir, but she left behind a legacy and monarchy worth noting.\\nElizabeth pursued with her goals of being well endowed with every aspect of her kingdom and knowing everything there was to know while being the reigning monarchy.\\nShe took part in law, economics, politics and governmental issues both domestic and abroad.\\nRealms that had once been strictly forbidden to the female gender were now being ruled by one.\\nShe pushed the barriers of tradition by never marrying nor giving into womanly duties.\\nShe was both a man and woman;

becomes clear that a Soviet counterstrike is imminent, the airmen panic.\\nSeveral stubbornly insist that they should stay at their post and take shelter in the silo, while others, including McCoy, point out that it is futile because the silo will not withstand a direct hit.\\nMcCoy tells them they have done their jobs and speeds away in an Air Force truck to retrieve his wife and child in Sedalia ( east of Whiteman AFB), but the truck is permanently disabled by an EMP from an airburst detonation.\\nMcCoy abandons the truck and takes shelter inside an overturned semi truck trailer,

preparations, downstairs into the basement.\\nWhile running to the shelter, the Dahlberg\\'s son, Danny, inadvertently looks behind him just as a missile detonated in the distance and is instantly blinded and carried back to the shelter by Dahlberg.\\nKU student Stephen Klein, while hitchhiking home to Joplin, Missouri, stumbles upon the farm and persuades the Dahlbergs to take him in.\\nAfter

offspring of Dinah, Alice\\'s cat in Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderlandâ\\x80\\x94when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror\\'s reflection.\\nClimbing up on the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she is able to step through it to an alternative world.\\nIn this reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass poetry, \"Jabberwocky\", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror.\\nShe also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.\\nChapter Two â\\x80\\x93 The Garden of Live Flowers: Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers have the power of human speech; they perceive Alice as being a \"flower that can move about\".\\nElsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds.\\nThis is a reference to the chess rule that queens are able to move any number of vacant squares at once, in any direction, which makes them the most \"agile\" of pieces.\\nChapter Three â\\x80\\x93 Looking-Glass Insects: The Red Queen reveals to Alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank/row in a chess match.\\nThis is a reference to the chess rule of Promotion.\\nAlice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen\\'s pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that literally jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, thus acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move.\\nChapter Four â\\x80\\x93 Tweedledum and Tweedledee: She then meets the fat twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from the famous nursery rhyme.\\nAfter reciting the long poem \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\", the Tweedles draw Alice\\'s attention to the Red Kingâ\\x80\\x94loudly snoring away under a nearby treeâ\\x80\\x94and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the Red King\\'s dreams (thereby implying that she will cease to exist the instant he wakes up).\\nFinally, the brothers begin acting out their nursery-rhyme by suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts.\\nChapter Five â\\x80\\x93 Wool and Water: Alice next meets the White Queen, who is very absent-minded but boasts of (and demonstrates) her ability to remember future events before they have happened.\\nAlice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard\\'s fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop.\\nAlice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about \"crabs\" and \"feathers\".\\nUnknown to Alice, these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing.\\nThus (for a change) the Queen/Sheep was speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way.\\nChapter Six â\\x80\\x93 Humpty Dumpty: After crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank, Alice immediately encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in \"Jabberwocky\".\\nIn the process, he introduces Alice (and the reader) to the concept of portmanteau words, before his inevitable fall.\\nChapter Seven â\\x80\\x93 The Lion and the Unicorn: \"All the king\\'s horses and all the king\\'s men\" come to Humpty Dumpty\\'s assistance, and are accompanied by the White King, along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting with each other.\\nIn this chapter, the March Hare and Hatter of the first book make a brief re-appearance in the guise of \"Anglo-Saxon messengers\" called \"Haigha\" and \"Hatta\" (ie.\\n\"Hare\" and \"Hatter\"â\\x80\\x94these names are the only hint given as to their identities other than John Tenniel\\'s illustrations).\\nChapter Eight â\\x80\\x93 â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s my own Inventionâ\\x80\\x9d: Upon leaving the Lion and Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who is intent on capturing the \"white pawn\"â\\x80\\x94who is Aliceâ\\x80\\x94until the White Knight comes to her rescue.\\nEscorting her through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, the Knight recites a long poem of his own composition called Haddocks\\' Eyes, and repeatedly falls off his horse.\\nHis clumsiness is a reference to the \"eccentric\" L-shaped movements of chess knights, and may also be interpreted as a self-deprecating joke about Lewis Carroll\\'s own physical awkwardness and stammering in real life.\\nChapter Nine â\\x80\\x93 Queen Alice: Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook, and is automatically crowned a queen, with the crown materialising abruptly on her head.\\nShe soon finds herself in the company of both the White and Red Queens, who relentlessly confound Alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion.\\nThey then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by the newly crowned Aliceâ\\x80\\x94of which Alice herself had no prior knowledge.\\nChapter Ten â\\x80\\x93 Shaking: Alice arrives and seats herself at her own party, which quickly turns to a chaotic uproarâ\\x80\\x94much like the ending of the first book.\\nAlice finally grabs the Red Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day\\'s nonsense, and begins shaking her violently with all her might.\\nBy thus \"capturing\" the Red Queen, Alice unknowingly puts the Red King (who has remained stationary throughout the book) into checkmate, and thus is allowed to wake up.\\nChapter Eleven â\\x80\\x93 Waking: Alice suddenly awakes in her armchair to find herself holding the black kitten, whom she deduces to have been the Red Queen all along, with the white kitten having been the White Queen.\\nChapter Twelve â\\x80\\x93 Which dreamed it.\\n: The story ends with Alice recalling the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have, in fact, been a dream of the Red King, and that Alice might herself be no more than a figment of his imagination.\\nOne final poem is inserted by the author as a sort of epilogue which suggests that life itself is but a dream.\\n',\n",

              " 256: 'Modern wuxia stories are largely set in ancient or pre-modern China.\\nThe historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story, to being vaguely-defined, anachronistic, or mainly for use as a backdrop.\\nElements of fantasy, such as the use of magic powers and appearance of supernatural beings, are common in some wuxia stories but are not a prerequisite of the wuxia genre.\\nHowever, the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale, as the characters must know some form of martial arts.\\nThemes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales.\\nA typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy â\\x80\\x93 such as the loss of his loved ones â\\x80\\x93 and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters.\\nAt the end of the story, he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal.\\nHe uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu.\\nFor instance, the opening chapters of some of Jin Yong\\'s works follow a certain pattern: a tragic event occurs, usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters, and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story.\\nOther stories use different structures.\\nFor instance, the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts sect.\\nHe experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him.\\nSome stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis.\\nThe plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis.\\nThese types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti-Qing revolutionaries.\\nCertain stories have unique plots, such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi.\\nGu Long\\'s works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories.\\nThe protagonist, usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem-solver, embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case.\\nHuang Yi\\'s stories are blended with science fiction.\\nDespite these genre-blending elements, wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction.\\nNotwithstanding this, wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist\\'s progression from childhood to adulthood instead.\\nThe progression may be symbolic rather than literal, as observed in Jin Yong\\'s The Smiling, Proud Wanderer, where Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master.\\nEight common attributes of the xia are listed as benevolence, justice, individualism, loyalty, courage, truthfulness, disregard for wealth, and desire for glory.\\nApart from individualism, these characteristics are similar to Confucian values such as ren (ä»\\x81; \"benevolence\", \"kindness\"), zhong (å¿\\xa0; \"loyalty\"), yong (å\\x8b\\x87; \"courage\", \"bravery\") and yi (ç¾©; \"righteousness\").\\nThe code of xia also emphasises the importance of repaying benefactors after having received deeds of en (æ\\x81©; \"grace\", \"favour\") from others, as well as seeking chou (ä»\\x87; \"vengeance\", \"revenge\") to bring villains to justice.\\nHowever, the importance of vengeance is controversial, as a number of wuxia works stress Buddhist ideals, which include forgiveness, compassion and a prohibition on killing.\\nIn the jianghu, martial artists are expected to be loyal to their master (sifu).\\nThis gives rise to the formation of several complex trees of master-apprentice relations as well as the various sects such as Shaolin and Wudang.\\nIf there are any disputes between fighters, they will choose the honourable way of settling their issues through fighting in duels.\\nThe martial arts in wuxia stories are based on wushu techniques and other real life Chinese martial arts.\\nIn wuxia tales, however, the mastery of such skills are highly exaggerated to superhuman levels of achievement and prowess.\\nThe following is a list of skills and abilities a typical fighter in a wuxia story possesses: In wuxia stories, characters attain the above skills and abilities by devoting themselves to years of diligent study and exercise, but can also have such power conferred upon them by a master who transfers his inner energy to them.\\nThe instructions to mastering these skills through training are found in secret manuals known as miji (ç§\\x98ç¬\\x88).\\nIn some stories, specific skills can be learned by spending several years in seclusion with a master or training with a group of fighters.\\nThe meaning of the term \"jianghu\" (æ±\\x9fæ¹\\x96; literally \"rivers and lakes\"; Cantonese: kong-woo) has evolved over the course of Chinese history.\\nFirst coined by Zhuangzi in the late 4th century BC, it was used to describe a way of life different from that of being actively involved in politics.\\nAt the time, it referred to the way of life of underachieving or maligned scholar-officials who distanced themselves from the circles of political power.\\nIn this sense, \"jianghu\" could be loosely interpreted as the way of life of a hermit.\\nOver the centuries, \"jianghu\" gained greater acceptance among the common people and gradually became a term used to describe a sub-society parallel to, and sometimes orthogonal to, mainstream society.\\nThis sub-society initially included merchants, craftsmen, beggars and vagabonds, but over time it assimilated bandits, outlaws and gangs who lived \"outside the existing law\".\\nDuring the Song and Yuan dynasties, bards and novelists began using the term \"jianghu\" to create a literature of a fictional society of adventurers and rebels who lived not by existing societal laws, but by their own moral principles.\\nThe core of these moral principles encompassed en (æ\\x81©; \"grace\", \"favour\"), yi (ç¾©; \"righteousness\"), and chou (ä»\\x87; \"vengeance\", \"revenge\").\\nStories in this genre bloomed and enriched various interpretations of \"jianghu\".\\nAt the same time, the term \"jianghu\" also developed intricate interconnections with gang culture because of outlaws\\' mutually shared distaste towards governments.\\nThe inclusion of martial arts as a feature of \"jianghu\" was a recent development in the early 20th century.\\nNovelists started creating a fantasy world in \"jianghu\" in which characters are martial artists and in which the characters\\' enforcement of righteousness is symbolised by conflicts between different martial artists or martial arts sects and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.\\nMartial arts became a tool used by characters in a \"jianghu\" story to enforce their moral beliefs.\\nOn the other hand, there are characters who become corrupted by power derived from their formidable prowess in martial arts and end up abandoning their morality in their pursuit of power.\\nAround this time, the term \"jianghu\" became closely related to a similar term, \"wulin\" (æ\\xad¦æ\\x9e\\x97; literally \"martial forest\"; Cantonese: mou-lam), which referred exclusively to a community of martial artists.\\nThis fantasy world of \"jianghu\" remains as the mainstream definition of \"jianghu\" in modern Chinese popular culture, particularly wuxia culture.\\nThe following description focuses more on the martial arts aspect of \"jianghu\", its well-established social norms, and its close relation with \"wulin\".\\nA common aspect of the jianghu is that the courts of law are dysfunctional and that all disputes and differences (within the community) can only be resolved by members of the community, through the use of mediation, negotiation or force, predicating the need for the code of xia and acts of chivalry.\\nLaw and order within the jianghu are maintained by the various orthodox and righteous sects and heroes.\\nSometimes these sects may gather to form an alliance against a powerful evil organisation in the jianghu.\\nA leader, called the \"wulin mengzhu\" (æ\\xad¦æ\\x9e\\x97ç\\x9b\\x9fä¸»; lit.\\n\"master of the wulin alliance\"), is elected from among the sects in order to lead them and ensure law and order within the jianghu.\\nThe leader is usually someone with a high level of mastery in martial arts and a great reputation for righteousness who is often involved in some conspiracy and/or killed.\\nIn some stories, the leader may not be the greatest martial artist in the jianghu; in other stories, the position of the leader is hereditary.\\nThe leader is an arbiter who presides and adjudicates over all inequities and disputes.\\nThe leader is a de jure chief justice of the affairs of the jianghu.\\nMembers of the jianghu are also expected to keep their distance from any government offices or officials, without necessarily being antagonistic.\\nIt was acceptable for jianghu members who are respectable members of society (usually owning properties or big businesses) to maintain respectful but formal and passive relationship with the officials, such as paying due taxes and attending local community events.\\nEven then, they are expected to shield any fugitives from the law, or at the least not to turn over fugitives to the officials.\\nLocal officials who are more savvy would know better than to expect co-operation from jianghu members, and would refrain from seeking help except to apprehend the worst and most notorious criminals.\\nIf the crimes also violated some of the moral tenets of jianghu, jianghu members may assist the government officials.\\nAn interesting aspect is that while senior officials are kept at a distance, jianghu members may freely associate with low-ranking staff such as runners, jailers, or clerks of the magistrates.\\nThe jianghu members maintained order among their own in the community and prevent any major disturbance, thus saving a lot of work for their associates in the yamen.\\nIn return, the runners turn a blind eye to certain jianghu activities that are officially disapproved, the jailers ensured incarcerated jianghu members are not mistreated, and the clerks pass on useful tips to the jianghu community.\\nThis reciprocal arrangement allowed their superiors to maintain order in their jurisdiction with the limited resources available and jianghu members greater freedom.\\nAlthough many jianghu members were Confucian-educated, their attitudess towards the way of life in the jianghu is largely overshadowed by pragmatism.\\nIn other words, they feel that Confucian values are to be respected and upheld if they are useful, and to be discarded if they are a hindrance.\\nThe basic (spoken and unspoken) norms of the jianghu are: The term \"jianghu\" is linked to cultures other than those pertaining to martial arts in wuxia stories.\\nIt is also applied to anarchic societies.\\nFor instance, the triads and other Chinese secret societies use the term \"jianghu\" to describe their world of organised crime.\\nSometimes, the term \"jianghu\" may be replaced by the term \"underworld\" Ã\\xa0 la \"criminal underworld\".\\nIn modern terminology, \"jianghu\" may mean any circle of interest, ranging from the entertainment industry to sports.\\nColloquially, retirement is also referred to as \"leaving the jianghu\" (é\\x80\\x80å\\x87ºæ±\\x9fæ¹\\x96).\\nIn wuxia stories, when a reputable fighter decides to retire from the jianghu, he will do so in a ceremony known as \"washing hands in the golden basin\" (é\\x87\\x91ç\\x9b\\x86æ´\\x97æ\\x89\\x8b).\\nHe washes his hands in a golden basin filled with water, signifying that he will no longer be involved in the affairs of the jianghu.\\nWhen a reclusive fighter who has retired from the jianghu reappears, his return is described as \"re-entering the jianghu\" (é\\x87\\x8då\\x87ºæ±\\x9fæ¹\\x96).\\n',\n",

Lucky\\'s \"thinking\" is a long-winded and disjointed monologue&mdash;it is the first and only time that Lucky speaks.\\nThe soliloquy begins as a relatively coherent and academic lecture on theology but quickly dissolves into mindless verbosity, escalating in both volume and speed, that agonises the others until Vladimir finally pulls off Lucky\\'s hat, stopping him in mid-sentence.\\nPozzo then has Lucky pack up his bags, and they hastily leave.\\nVladimir and Estragon, alone again, reflect on whether they met Pozzo and Lucky before.\\nA boy then arrives, purporting to be a messenger sent from Godot to tell the pair that Godot will not be coming that evening \"but surely tomorrow\".\\nDuring Vladimir\\'s interrogation of the boy, he asks if he came the day before, making it apparent that the two men have been waiting for a long period and will likely continue.\\nAfter the boy departs, the moon appears and the two men verbally agree to leave and find shelter for the night, but they merely stand without moving.\\nIt is daytime again and Vladimir begins singing a recursive round about the death of a dog, but twice forgets the lyrics as he sings.\\nAgain, Estragon claims to have been beaten last night, despite no apparent injury.\\nVladimir comments that the formerly bare tree now has leaves and tries to confirm his recollections of yesterday against Estragon\\'s extremely vague, unreliable memory.\\nVladimir then triumphantly produces evidence of the previous day\\'s events by showing Estragon the wound from when Lucky kicked him.\\nNoticing Estragon\\'s barefootedness, they also discover his previously forsaken boots nearby, which Estragon insists are not his, although they fit him perfectly.\\nWith no carrots left, Vladimir is turned down in offering Estragon a turnip or a radish.\\nHe then sings Estragon to sleep with a lullaby before noticing further evidence to confirm his memory: Lucky\\'s hat still lies on the ground.\\nThis leads to his waking Estragon and involving him in a frenetic hat-swapping scene.\\nThe two then wait again for Godot, while distracting themselves by playfully imitating Pozzo and Lucky, firing insults at each other and then making up, and attempting some fitness routines&mdash;all of which fail miserably and end quickly.\\nSuddenly, Pozzo and Lucky reappear, but the rope is much shorter than during their last visit, and Lucky now guides Pozzo, rather than being controlled by him.\\nAs they arrive, Pozzo trips over Lucky and they together fall into a motionless heap.\\nEstragon sees an opportunity to exact revenge on Lucky for kicking him earlier.\\nThe issue is debated lengthily until Pozzo shocks the pair by revealing that he is now blind and Lucky is now mute.\\nPozzo further claims to have lost all sense of time, and assures the others that he cannot remember meeting them before, but also does not expect to recall today\\'s events tomorrow.\\nHis commanding arrogance from yesterday appears to have been replaced by humility and insight.\\nHis parting words&mdash;which Vladimir expands upon later&mdash;are ones of utter despair.\\nLucky and Pozzo depart; meanwhile Estragon has again fallen asleep.\\nAlone, Vladimir is encountered by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether he might be the other boy\\'s brother.\\nThis time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow.\\nVladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet.\\nEstragon awakes and pulls his boots off again.\\nHe and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon\\'s belt (hoping to use it as a noose), it breaks and Estragon\\'s trousers fall down.\\nThey resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last.\\nAgain, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.\\n',\n",

monoliths increase Jupiter\\'s density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion, becoming a small star.\\nIn the novel, this obliterates the primitive life forms inhabiting the Jovian atmosphere, which the Monoliths\\' controllers had deemed very unlikely to ever achieve intelligence unlike the aquatic life of Europa.\\nAs Jupiter is about to transform, Bowman returns to Discovery to give HAL a last order to carry out.\\nHAL begins repeatedly broadcasting the message  The creation of the new star, which Earth eventually names Lucifer, destroys Discovery.\\nHowever, in appreciation for HAL\\'s help, Bowman has the aliens which control the monoliths remove HAL\\'s artificial intelligence from Discovery\\'s computer core and transform him into the same kind of life form as David Bowman, and become his companion.\\nThe book ends with a brief epilogue, which takes place in AD 20,001, but this may also mean Europan years, which is approximately 190 Earth years, so approximately AD 2250.\\nBy this time, the Europans have evolved into a species that has developed a primitive civilization, most likely with assistance from a monolith.\\nThey are not described in detail, though they are said to have \"tendril\"-like limbs.\\nThey regard the star Lucifer (formerly the planet Jupiter) as their primary sun, referring to Sol as \"The Cold Sun\".\\nThough their settlements are concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of Europa which is constantly bathed in Lucifer\\'s rays, some Europans have begun in recent generations to explore the Farside, the hemisphere facing away from Lucifer, which is still covered in ice.\\nThere they may witness the spectacle of night, unknown on the other side of Europa, when the Cold Sun sets.\\nThe Europans who explore the Farside have been carefully observing the night sky and have begun to develop a mythology based on their observations.\\nThey correctly believe that Lucifer was not always there.\\nThey believe that the Cold Sun was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime.\\nThe Europans also see three other major bodies in the sky.\\nOne seems to be constantly engulfed in fire, and the other two have lights on them which are gradually spreading.\\nThese three bodies are the moons Io, Callisto, and Ganymede, the latter two of which are presently being colonized by humans.\\nHumans have been attempting to explore Europa ever since Lucifer was created in 2010.\\nHowever, none of these attempts has been successful.\\nEvery probe that has attempted to land on Europa has been destroyed on approach.\\nThe debris from every probe falls to the surface of the planet, and the debris from some of the first ships to be destroyed is venerated by the Europans.\\nFinally, there is a Monolith on the planet, which is worshipped by the Europans more than anything else.\\nThe Europans assume, correctly, that the Monolith is what keeps humans at bay.\\nDave Bowman and HAL lie dormant in this Monolith.\\nThe Monolith is the guardian of Europa, and will continue to prevent contact between humans and Europans for as long as it sees fit.\\n',\n",

Bernard Marx, and others.\\nLenina, a hatchery worker, is socially accepted and contented, but Bernard, a psychologist in the Directorate of Hatcheries and Conditioning, is not.\\nHe is shorter in stature than the average of his Alpha casteâ\\x80\\x94a quality shared by the lower castes, which gives him an inferiority complex.\\nHis intelligence and his work with hypnopaedia allow him to understand, and disapprove of, the methods by which society is sustained.\\nCourting disaster, he is vocal and arrogant about his differences.\\nBernard is mocked by other Alphas because of his stature, as well as for his individualistic tendencies, and is threatened with exile to Iceland because of his nonconformity.\\nHis only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering.\\nThe friendship is based on their feelings of being misfits (in the context of the World State), but unlike Bernard, Watson\\'s sense of alienation stems from being exceptionally gifted, intelligent, handsome, and physically strong.\\nHelmholtz is drawn to Bernard as a confidant.\\nBernard takes a holiday with Lenina at a Savage Reservation in New Mexico.\\n(The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the Anasazi, including the Puebloan peoples of Acoma, Laguna and Zuni) There they observe ceremonies, including a ritual in which a village boy is whipped into unconsciousness.\\nThey encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man.\\nShe too visited the reservation on a holiday, and became separated from her group and was left behind.\\nShe had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow-holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard\\'s boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning).\\nShe did not try to return to \"civilization\" because of her shame at her pregnancy.\\nNeither Linda nor John are accepted by the villagers, and their life has been hard and unpleasant.\\nLinda has taught John to read, although from only two books: a scientific manual from his mother\\'s job in the hatchery and the collected works of Shakespeare.\\nOstracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, especially the tragedies of Othello, Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet.\\nLinda now wants to return to London, while John wants to see the \"brave new world\" his mother has told him about.\\nBernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back.\\nOn his return to London, Bernard is confronted by the Director, but turns the tables by presenting him with his long-lost lover and unknown son.\\nJohn calls the Director his \"father\", a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter.\\nThe humiliated Director resigns in shame.\\nBernard, as \"custodian\" of the \"savage\" John who is now treated as a celebrity, is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned.\\nHowever, his triumph is short-lived.\\nDecrepit and friendless, Linda goes on a permanent soma, that is, drugged, holiday while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society.\\nSociety drops Bernard as swiftly as it had taken him.\\nLenina and John are physically attracted to each other, but John\\'s view of courtship and romance, based on Shakespeare, is utterly incompatible with Lenina\\'s freewheeling attitude to sex.\\nLenina tries to seduce John, but he attacks her for being an \"impudent strumpet\".\\nJohn is then informed that his mother is extremely ill.\\nHe rushes to her bedside, causing a scandal as this is not the \"correct\" attitude to death.\\nSome Delta children who enter the ward for \"death-conditioning\" irritate John to the point where he attacks one physically.\\nHe then tries to break up a distribution of soma to a lower-caste group and is set upon by the outraged recipients.\\nHelmholtz, who has been called by Bernard, also becomes involved in the fracas.\\nBernard, Helmholtz and John are brought before Mustapha Mond, the Resident \"World Controller for Western Europe\".\\nBernard and Helmholtz are told they are to be exiled to islands, seen by society at large as a punishment for antisocial activity.\\nBernard pleads grovelling for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be an individual, and chooses the Falkland Islands as his destination, believing that their bad weather will inspire his writing.\\nMond says that Bernard does not know that exile is actually a reward.\\nThe islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit in the World State community.\\nMond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control.\\nJohn rejects Mond\\'s arguments, and Mond sums up by saying that John demands \"the right to be unhappy\".\\nJohn asks if he may go to the islands as well but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to \"continue the experiment\".\\nJohn moves to an abandoned hilltop \"air-lighthouse\" (meant to warn and guide helicopters) there, near the village of Puttenham, where he intends to adopt an ascetic lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization and make amends for his mistreatment of his mother.\\nHe practises self-mortification, and his self-flagellation is witnessed by bystanders, turning him into a sensational spectacle.\\nHundreds of sightseers, hoping to witness his behaviour, arrive at John\\'s lighthouse; one of them is Lenina.\\nAt the sight of the woman he both adores and loathes, John attacks her with his whip.\\nThe onlookers are whipped into a frenzy by the display and John is caught up in a soma-fueled orgy.\\nThe next morning, John remembers the previous night\\'s events and is stricken with remorse.\\nOnlookers and journalists who arrive that evening find that he has hanged himself, his body twisting aimlessly in the lighthouse.\\n',\n",

whom he has arranged for her to marry.\\nHelena meanwhile pines unrequitedly for Demetrius.\\nEnraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian law before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or else face death.\\nTheseus offers her another choice: lifelong chastity while worshipping the goddess Artemis as a nun.\\nPeter Quince and his fellow players Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Robin Starveling, Tom Snout, and Snug plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, \"the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe\".\\nQuince reads the names of characters and bestows them to the players.\\nNick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time.\\nHe would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles.\\nBottom is told by Quince that he would do the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and ladies enough for the Duke and Lords to have the players hanged.\\nQuince ends the meeting with \"at the Duke\\'s oak we meet\".\\nIn a parallel plot line, Oberon, king of the fairies, and Titania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens.\\nTitania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta\\'s wedding.\\nOberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his \"knight\" or \"henchman\", since the child\\'s mother was one of Titania\\'s worshippers.\\nOberon seeks to punish Titania\\'s disobedience.\\nHe calls upon Robin \"Puck\" Goodfellow, his \"shrewd and knavish sprite\", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called \"love-in-idleness\", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid\\'s arrow.\\nWhen the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive.\\nHe instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy.\\nHe says, \"And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As I can take it with another herb,/I\\'ll make her render up her page to

abandoned her, and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her.\\nThe four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater.\\nOberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.\\nMeanwhile, Quince and his band of six labourers (\"rude mechanicals\", as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus\\' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania\\'s bower, for their rehearsal.\\nBottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey.\\nWhen Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom\\'s confusion.\\nDetermined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself.\\nTitania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom\\'s singing and immediately falls in love with him.\\nShe lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the changeling.\\nHaving achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey\\'s head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken.\\nPuck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena\\'s love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart.\\nEventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade.\\nOnce they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, claiming all will be well in the morning.\\nThe fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt.\\nThey wake the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus\\'s demands and arranges a group wedding.\\nThe lovers decide that the night\\'s events must have been a dream.\\nAfter they exit,

performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed.\\nAfterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and

the disease claimed his wife and daughter, and he was forced to kill his wife after she seemingly rose from the dead as a vampire and attacked him.\\nNeville survives by barricading himself by sunset inside his house, further protected by garlic, mirrors, and crucifixes.\\nSwarms of vampires, led by Neville\\'s neighbor, Ben Cortman, regularly surround his house, trying to find ways to get inside.\\nDuring the day, he scavenges for supplies and searches out the inactive vampires, driving stakes into their hearts to kill them.\\nHe finds brief solace in a stray dog that finds its way to his house.\\nDesperate for company, Neville slowly earns the dog\\'s trust with food and brings it into the house.\\nDespite his efforts, the dog proves to be infected and dies a week later.\\nAfter bouts of depression and alcoholism, Neville decides to find out the scientific cause of the pandemic.\\nHe obtains books and other research materials from a library, and through painstaking research discovers the root of the disease in a strain of bacteria capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts.\\nHe also discovers that the vampires are affected by the garlic, mirrors, and crosses because of \"hysterical blindness\", the result of previous psychological conditioning of the infected.\\nDriven insane by the disease, the infected now react as they believe they should when confronted with these items.\\nEven then, their reaction is constrained to the beliefs of the particular person; for example, a Christian vampire would fear the cross, but a Jewish vampire would not.\\nNeville also discovers more efficient means of killing the vampires, other than just driving a stake into their hearts.\\nThis includes exposing them to direct sunlight (which kills the bacteria) or inflicting deep wounds on their bodies so that the bacteria switch from being anaerobic symbionts to aerobic parasites, rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air.\\nHe is now killing such large numbers of vampires in his daily forays that his nightly visitors have diminished significantly.\\nAfter three years, Neville sees an apparently uninfected woman, Ruth, in broad daylight, and captures her.\\nAfter some convincing, Ruth tells him her story of how she and her husband survived the pandemic (though her husband was killed two weeks earlier).\\nNeville is puzzled by the fact that she is upset when he speaks of killing vampires; he thinks that if her story of survival was true, she would have become hardened to the act.\\nHe attempts to test whether she is a vampire by exposing her to garlic, which causes her to recoil violently.\\nAt night Neville is startled awake and finds Ruth fully clothed at the front door of the house.\\nSuspicious, he questions her motives, but relates the trauma of his past, whereupon they comfort each other.\\nRuth reluctantly allows him to take a blood sample but knocks him unconscious when the sample reveals that she is infected.\\nWhen he wakes, Neville discovers a note from Ruth confessing that she is actually infected and that Neville was responsible for her husband\\'s death.\\nRuth admits that she was sent to spy on him.\\nIt turns out that only the infected created from reanimated corpses are utterly feral, but not those who were alive when they were infected.\\nThe living-infected have slowly overcome their disease until they can spend short periods of time in sunlight, and are attempting to build a new society.\\nThey have developed medication which helps them to overcome the most severe symptoms of the infection.\\nRuth warns Neville that her people will attempt to capture him, and that he should leave his house and escape to the mountains.\\nNeville cannot bring himself to leave his house, however, and assumes that he will be captured and treated fairly by the new society.\\nInfected members of the new society eventually attack the house.\\nDuring the attack, the members of the new society violently dispatch the other feral vampires outside the house, and Neville becomes alarmed at the grim enjoyment they appear to take from this task.\\nRealising that the intention of the attackers may be to kill him rather than to capture him he tries to defend himself with a pistol, leading to one of the infected shooting and badly injuring him.\\nNeville wakes in a barred cell where he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is a ranking member of the new society but, unlike the others, does not resent him.\\nRuth attempts to present a facade of indifference to Neville, but is unable to maintain it during her discussion with him.\\nAfter discussing the effects of Neville\\'s vampire-killing activities on the new society, she acknowledges the need for Neville\\'s execution and gives him pills, claiming they will \"make it easier\".\\nFatally injured, Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not to let this society become heartless.\\nRuth kisses him and leaves.\\nNeville goes to his prison window and sees the infected waiting for his execution.\\nHe now sees that the infected view him with the same hatred and fear that he once felt for the vampires; he realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a legend to the new race born of the infection: just as vampires are monsters which hunt humans during the time of day they are not active (night), he is a feared monster that hunts the vampires during the daylight hours when they are asleep.\\nHe recognises that their desire to kill him is not something he can condemn.\\nAs the pills take effect, he thinks: \"[I am] a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever.\\nI am legend\".\\n',\n",

unknown character whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom\\'s church.\\nThe setting is based around this character, named by default as Ramza, and revolves around his early life and the future conflicts he faced while the events that changed the kingdom unfold.\\nCentral to the plot of the game are two main characters, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral.\\nThe two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner, both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza\\'s father Balbanes.\\nHowever, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to manipulate the upper class to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.\\nThe game\\'s plot is then portrayed through the eyes of Ramza Beoulve, who is the player

possible to secure their place in the throne.\\nThis includes bearing an illegitimate child, killing other possible heirs, betrayal, assassination and false identities.\\nThroughout the game, nobles regard commoners and peasants as animals, and many commoners try to take revenge on the nobles, who abandoned them after the war.\\nMost joined the so-called Death Corps to fight against the nobles\\'

              " 404: 'Final Fantasy VI takes place on a large, unnamed world.\\nDuring the course of the game, its geography and landscape change due to various developments in the game\\'s plot.\\nDuring the first half of the game, the world is divided into three major continents and referred to as the World of Balance.\\nThe northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations accessible to the player.\\nMost of the southern continent has been taken over by the Empire, while the eastern continent is home to a large patch of land called the Veldt where monsters from all over the world can be found.\\nHalfway through the game, the world\\'s geographical layout is altered, resulting in its three large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger continent at their center.\\nThis altered layout of the game\\'s locations is referred to as the World of Ruin.\\nIn contrast to the medieval settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy VI is set in what is now known as a steampunk environment.\\nThe structure of society parallels that of the latter half of the 19th century, with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game, and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution.\\nRailroads and steamships are in use, and a coal mining operation is run in the northern town of Narshe.\\nAdditionally, several examples of modern engineering and weaponry (such as a chainsaw and drill) have been developed in the Kingdom of Figaro.\\nHowever, communication systems have not reached significant levels of development, with letters sent by way of carrier pigeon serving as the most common means of long-distance communication.\\nA thousand years before the events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi.\\nThis quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espersâ\\x80\\x94magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war.\\nEventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues.\\nTheir only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again.\\nThe espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans.\\nThe concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology.\\nAt the game\\'s opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo.\\nApproximately eighteen years before the events of the game begin, the barrier between the espers\\' land and the rest of the world weakened.\\nSoon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers\\' land, capturing several of them.\\nUsing the espers as a power source, Gestahl initiated a research program to combine magic with machinery and infuse humans with magical powers, the result being a craft known as \"Magitek\".\\nKefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights, drastically impairing his sanity.\\nMagitek innovations have allowed the Empire to supplement its forces with mechanical infantry, armed with Magitek-powered weaponry.\\nAt the opening of the game, the Empire is on the verge of rediscovering the full potential of magic by reopening the gateway to the world of the espers.\\nHowever, Gestahl\\'s military dominion is opposed by the Returners, a rebel organization seeking to overthrow the Empire and free its territories.\\nFinal Fantasy VI features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player.\\nThe starting character, Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love.\\nOther primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Figaro, a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners; Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar\\'s brother, who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends as a result of Kefka poisoning the kingdom\\'s water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler and thrill seeker and owner of the world\\'s only airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary, who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm\\'s elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the Veldt; Mog, a Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal sasquatch also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog\\'s persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.\\nMost of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who serves as one of the game\\'s main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl.\\nThe supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game.\\nA handful of Final Fantasy VI characters have reappeared in later games, such as Secret of Evermore.\\nAdditionally, Final Fantasy SGI, a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation, featured polygon-based 3D renderings of Locke, Terra, and Shadow.\\nA mind-controlled Terra Branford participates in an Imperial raid on Narshe in search of a recently unearthed frozen esper (later identified as Tritoch; Valigarmanda in the GBA retranslation) found in the city\\'s mines.\\nThe esper then kills Terra\\'s controllers and breaks the Imperial control over her, but she is unable to remember anything about her past.\\nLocke Cole, a treasure hunter, promises to protect her until she can regain her memories and helps her escape to the hideout of the Returners, a group of militants opposing the Empire.\\nAlong the way, they pass through the Kingdom of Figaro and meet Edgar Roni Figaro, the king, and his estranged brother, Sabin Rene Figaro, who join them.\\nBanon, the leader of the Returners, asks for Terra\\'s help in their struggle against the Empire, and she agrees.\\nJust as the resistance is preparing to return to Narshe to investigate the frozen esper, the Empire attacks South Figaro.\\nLocke heads to the besieged town to slow the Empire\\'s advance, while the rest of the group makes their way via rafting down the nearby Lethe River.\\nHowever, Sabin is separated from the group after a battle with Ultros, self-proclaimed \"octopus royalty\" and a recurring antagonist, forcing the various members of the Returners to find their own ways to Narshe in three different scenarios controlled by the player.\\nIn Locke\\'s scenario, he must escape the imperial occupied town of South Figaro without detection.\\nSabin has been swept to a distant continent and must find a way back while Terra, Edgar, and Banon will continue to float down the Lethe River back to Narshe.\\nEventually, the original party reunites in Narshe.\\nLocke brings with him Celes Chere, one of the Empire\\'s own generals, whom he saved from execution for defying the Empire\\'s ruthless practices.\\nSabin brings with him Cyan Garamonde, whose family was killed during the Empire\\'s siege of Doma Castle when Kefka Palazzo ordered the water supply poisoned, and Gau, a feral child he befriended on the Veldt.\\nIn Narshe, the Returners prepare to defend the frozen esper from the Empire.\\nAfter the player successfully thwarts the Imperial invasion, Terra approaches the frozen esper, prompting her to transform into an esper-like form herself.\\nShe flies away, confused and horrified by her own transformation.\\nThe Returners set out to search for Terra and eventually trace her to the city of Zozo, though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper.\\nThere, they also meet the esper Ramuh, who tells them that if they free various other espers from the Magitek Research Facility in the Empire\\'s capital, Vector, they may find one who can help Terra.\\nVector is on the southern continent, to which the Empire does not allow maritime access, so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani, who is believed to be the owner of the Blackjack, the only airship in the world.\\nThey then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers, including Maduin, who is revealed to be Terra\\'s father.\\nHowever, the espers are already dying from the experiments at Vector, and choose instead to give their lives to transform into magiciteâ\\x80\\x94the crystallized remains of the espers\\' essences that form when they die and allow others to use their powers.\\nThe dying espers bestow their magicite upon the Returners.\\nBefore the group can then escape, Kefka arrives and causes the Returners, including Locke, to momentarily doubt Celes\\' loyalty, much to her anguish.\\nHowever, she provides proof to them of her support by covering for the group while the rest escape.\\nThe rest of the group then returns to Zozo, where Terra reacts to the magicite of her father, prompting her to gain knowledge of her past and accept herself as the half-human, half-esper child of Maduin and a human woman.\\nAfter reuniting with Terra, the Returners decide that it is time to launch an all-out attack on the Empire, and Banon asks Terra to attempt contacting the espers\\' land in order to gain their support.\\nTerra succeeds in making contact, and when the espers learn that the others captured by the Empire previously have now perished, they become infuriated and enter the human world, where they destroy much of Vector.\\nWhen the Returners arrive in the capital, they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight, inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace.\\nGestahl asks Terra to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf, to which she agrees.\\nAccompanied by Locke, Shadow (a ninja mercenary hired by the Empire for the mission), Generals Celes and Leo, the player must then guide Terra to the remote village Thamasa in search of the espers, where they meet Strago Magus and his granddaughter, Relm Arrowny, who also accompany them.\\nSoon, they find the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl.\\nHowever, during the negotiations, Kefka attacks the espers, killing each of those still alive and capturing the magicite that remains from their essence.\\nAdditionally, he kills General Leo, who is appalled by Kefka\\'s dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers.\\nThe Returners reunite, now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers\\' now-unsealed land.\\nKefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world, find the Warring Triad, and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and fly in the sky as an ominous Floating Continent.\\nThe Returners attempt to stop them from causing further damage, but despite their efforts, they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues.\\nNow empowered, Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment, upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world.\\nIn the disaster, the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer\\'s airship is torn apart.\\nOne year later, Celes awakens from a coma on a deserted island and learns that the world has been devastated by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler.\\nMuch of the human population has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, punctuating humanity\\'s despair.\\nCeles sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find.\\nCeles is only required by the game\\'s story to reunite with Sabin and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, in a series of mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo.\\nTogether, this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka\\'s Tower.\\nInside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka\\'s defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka\\'s newfound power.\\nWhen destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.\\nMaking a final stand against Kefka, the characters destroy him, but since the gods\\' power had come to reside in him all magicite begins to shatter and Kefka\\'s magically-maintained tower begins to crumble.\\nThe Returners make their escape, though if Terra is present, she begins to weaken due to her half-esper heritage.\\nHowever, before her father\\'s magicite shatters, his spirit informs her that by holding to the human side of herself, she may survive the passing of magic.\\nIn the end, the party escapes Kefka\\'s Tower aboard the Falcon.\\nTerra survives, and the group observes the world\\'s communities rejuvenating themselves.\\n',\n",

however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form.\\nOther fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which appears in most Final Fantasy games.\\nSpira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous Final Fantasy games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.\\nThere are seven main playable characters in Final Fantasy X, starting with Tidus, a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira.\\nTo do so, he joins Yuna, a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like \"Sin\".\\nJourneying with them are: Kimahri Ronso, a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood; Wakka, a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin; and Lulu, a stoic black mage close to Yuna and Wakka.\\nDuring the journey, they are joined by Auron, a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus\\' and Yuna\\'s fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior; and Rikku, Yuna\\'s cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.\\nThe main protagonist Tidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city.\\nTidus narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game\\'s storyline.\\nIt begins in Tidus\\'s home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned star of the underwater sport blitzball, and son of the famous blitzball star, Jecht.\\nDuring a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\".\\nSin destroys Zanarkand, taking Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira.\\nUpon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers in the area, who speak a language that is foreign to Tidus.\\nUpon asking him where he is from, one of them, Rikku, who speaks the same language as Tidus, tells him that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago.\\nAfter Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team, when he impresses them with his blitzball skills.\\nWakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin with her guardians Lulu, a mage of black magic, and Kimahri, a member of the Ronso tribe.\\nMeanwhile, Tidus joins to help Wakka in the upcoming blitzball tournament to find a way back home.\\nThe party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its \"offspring\"â\\x80\\x94fiends called Sinspawn.\\nAfter the tournament, they are joined by Auron, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna\\'s guardian.\\nHe reveals to Tidus that Yuna\\'s father, Lord Braska; Tidus\\'s father, Jecht; and himself made the same pilgrimage to defeat Sin ten years ago.\\nTidus thought his father had died at sea ten years earlier.\\nFollowing another attack from Sin, they are joined by Rikku, later revealed to be Yuna\\'s cousin.\\nWhen the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado, Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira\\'s sorrow.\\nAt Macalania Temple, the group sees a message from Seymour\\'s father Jyscal\\'s spirit, who declares he was killed by his son, who now aims to destroy Spira.\\nThe group reunites with Yuna to engage Seymour in battle, killing him; soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna from the others.\\nWhile searching for her on Bikanel Island, the homeland of the Al Bhed where they had surfaced, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive.\\nThe group finds Yuna in Bevelle, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour.\\nThey crash the wedding and escape with Yuna.\\nThe group is captured at the Bevelle temple, and are ordered to stand trial.\\nAfter escaping from their sentence, the group heads towards the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game.\\nOn the way there, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people.\\nLong ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated.\\nZanarkand\\'s survivors became \"fayth\" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira.\\nOne thousand years after its creation, the fayth have become exhausted from \"dreaming\" their Zanarkand, but are unable to stop due to Sin\\'s influence.\\nOnce they reach Zanarkand, Yunalescaâ\\x80\\x94the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever sinceâ\\x80\\x94tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner.\\nAfter defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue.\\nYuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn.\\nDisappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus\\' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon.\\nAfter the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin\\'s cycle of rebirth.\\nThis leads the group to infiltrate Sin\\'s body to battle Seymour, and Jecht\\'s imprisoned spirit.\\nWith Sin\\'s host defeated, Tidus\\' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon.\\nSin\\'s cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira\\'s fayth are freed from their imprisonment.\\nAuron, who had earlier been revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane.\\nJust then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning.\\nAfterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin.\\nIn a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water.\\nHe then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.\\n',\n",

of the world.\\nIt had been a center for trade and knowledge, and the world\\'s people met there to peacefully settle their differences.\\nBut on one warm summer day, powerful monsters stormed the Tower, stole the four crystals, and then took off with the magical coins that kept the Tower\\'s doors unlocked.\\nThe monsters began consuming the power of the crystals; they grew in strength while the world began to decay.\\nAn old prophecy tells that at the time the \"vile four\" steal the power and divide the world behind four doors, a knight will appear to vanquish the darkness.\\nThe game

Sweetscent, an organ-transplant doctor who gets wrapped up in Earth-Lilistar politics.\\nAt the onset of the story, Sweetscent is the personal org-trans surgeon for Virgil Ackerman, the president of Tijuana Fur & Dye.\\nUsing an extraterrestrial amoeba which can imitate the cell-structure of anything it touches, TF&D had been the largest manufacturer of synthetic furs on the planet.\\nBut like all major corporations on Earth, TF&D has been requisitioned to produce for the war effort.\\nAckerman invites Sweetscent to \"Wash-35\", a recreation of his boyhood native Washington DC in a simulated 1935 and his vacation getaway on Mars, where he announces an ulterior motive in the retreat.\\nWaiting for them when they arrive is a guestâ\\x80\\x94Gino Molinari, the elected leader of Earth.\\nKnown as \"the Mole\", he is rumored to have the enigmatic ability to come back from the dead, and he has requested the services of Sweetscent.\\nAckerman gladly passes Sweetscent on to Molinari.\\nMeanwhile, Sweetscent\\'s wife, Kathy, tries JJ-180, a new hallucinogenic drug which proves to be highly toxic and addictive.\\nThe effects of JJ-180 are not clear at first, however, only hours off of it, Kathy finds herself unable to function and violently craving JJ-180 again.\\nShe is visited by \\'Starmen who claim the reegs invented JJ-180 as a chemical weapon against the \\'Starmen and Terrans, also stating that there is no known cure for the drug\\'s addiction and \\'That\\'s why we put you on it\\'.\\nKathy is now a slave to JJ-180.\\nThe \\'Starmen inform Kathy of her husband\\'s new position with Molinari and suspect the latter\\'s possible defection to the reegs.\\nKathy is promised more JJ-180 if she agrees to spy on her husband for Lilistar.\\nThreatened with deportation, Kathy capitulates and agrees to their terms.\\nEventually, she takes a second dose of the drug as her ability to function becomes nearly impossible due the effects of the withdrawal.\\nJumping into a taxi-cab, both she and the cab are plunged back in time to the 1930s.\\nAs the effects of the drug wear off, they slowly make their way back to the present time, uncertain as to whether the past they visited was their own or an alternate one.\\nAn increasingly paranoid Kathy sets off to visit her husband.\\nUnder his new employer Eric Sweetscent is let in on certain State secrets: Molinari seems to have a psychosomatic condition that mirrors any illness or disease of anyone in his vicinity.\\nThe effects of this condition appear to be real, yet the Mole pulls through every time, always returning from the brink of death.\\nMolinari, like everyone else, has realized that in siding with the \\'Starmen Earth has doomed itself to the wrong side of a losing war.\\nHowever, there does not seem to be any safe way of defecting to the reegs, and Molinari fears that his deteriorating health will not instill confidence in the Terrans should the \\'Starmen retaliate, as they are certain to do.\\nSweetscent is shown footage of a healthier, younger Molinari in uniform and is led to believe that an android look-alike of the President has been created for public appearances, a notion that does not account for the fact that there is at least one other Molinari on the premises, a bullet-ridden corpse that is being preserved for use in the event of certain possible future developments.\\nKathy arrives to inform her husband of her addiction, and in an effort to motivate him to find a cure she slips a pill of JJ-180 into his drink.\\nWithout enough time to be furious, Eric slips a year into the future of an alternate world where his colleagues inform him that he disappeared the day Kathy came to visit.\\nSweetscent also witnesses that in the new timeline Earth has sided with the reegs and Lilistar has lost the war.\\nUpon returning to the present of his own timeline, Sweetscent is eager to present this information to Molinari, who reveals that he too has been taking JJ-180, and that the effect is different for each user.\\nCertain users are sent to the past, while others are sent to the future.\\nEach trip is in an alternate universe, and therefore no one can effectively change their own past or future.\\nHowever, aside from minor details, events in all observed universes seem to be moving in the same direction, and therefore, information obtained from one alternate world\\'s future will most likely be applicable to another.\\nIn Molinari\\'s case he slips sideways in time under the drug\\'s influence and is able to pull alternate versions of his present self into his own timeline and then keep them there.\\nHaving learned the secret to Molinari\\'s alter-aliases as well as confirming the feasibility of an alliance with the reegs, Eric takes a larger dose of JJ-180 which propels him further into the future.\\nWhile there, he obtains a cure for JJ-180\\'s addiction, an item of wide accessibility in the future, as well as obtaining more information about the possible future of the war in his own timeline.\\nHe also gathers information as to the effects of JJ-180 on the brain as he is increasingly worried about Kathy\\'s mental condition.\\nTaking a fraction of a pill so as to not immediately return to his own time, Eric again ends up one year in his own future where the \\'Starmen have occupied Earth after learning of the Terrans\\' defection to the reegs.\\nHe is arrested by a \\'Star patrol but saved by his future self, who informs him that Ackerman and the rest of the crew at TF&D have taken a stand against Lilistar, using Ackerman\\'s getaway on Mars as their hideout.\\nNow knowing the general future history of the next few years, Eric returns to his own time where his wife\\'s mental condition is deteriorating every day.\\nHe resolves to check her into a clinic and is sent into deep reflection about the nature of their relationship.\\nFeeling that he would be justified, he attempts to arrange an affair with a younger girl at Molinari\\'s recommendation.\\nHowever, he backs out of it and begins to slip into a deep depression while reflecting on his life.\\nHe goes to Mexico to purchase poison with which to commit suicide.\\nDeciding against it at the last second, Eric watches as the \\'Starmen begin their invasion of Earth.\\nDeciding that he is destined to join Ackerman\\'s resistance against the \\'Starmen, Eric enters an automated cab bound for TF&D, asking it what it would do if its wife suffered from brain-damage without possibility of recovery (which Eric had confirmed by contacting his future self).\\nAfter pointing out that robots do not marry, the cab hypothetically concludes that it would stay with her.\\nLife, argues the cab, is made up of a series of circumstances, different for each person.\\nTo leave one\\'s wife would be to say that he requires a uniquely easier set of circumstances than what has been provided.\\nThat reasoning, to the cab, was an irrational way of thinking.\\nEric agrees and decides to stay with his wife despite the challenges presented by her condition, and in the closing paragraph is commended by the cab for being a \\'good man\\'.\\n',\n",

              " 441: 'The novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character.\\nThe novel\\'s setting is somewhere in the north of England, during the reign of George III (1760â\\x80\\x931820), and goes through five distinct stages: Jane\\'s childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, st John Rivers, proposes to her; and her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester.\\nDuring these sections the novel provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo (see the Themes section below).\\nLiterary critic Jerome Beaty opines that the close first person perspective leaves the reader \"too uncritically accepting of her worldview\", and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting Jane, regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives are.\\nJane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters, and most editions are at least 400 pages long.\\nThe original publication was in three volumes, comprising chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38; this was a common publishing format during the 19th century (see three-volume novel).\\nBrontÃ« dedicated the novel\\'s second edition to William Makepeace Thackeray.\\nThe novel begins with the titular character, Jane Eyre, aged 10, living with her maternal uncle\\'s family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle\\'s dying wish.\\nIt is several years after her parents died of typhus.\\nmr Reed, Jane\\'s uncle, was the only person in the Reed family who was kind to Jane.\\nJane\\'s aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, treats her as a burden, and discourages her children from associating with Jane.\\nmrs Reed and her three children are abusive to Jane, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.\\nThe nursemaid Bessie proves to be Jane\\'s only ally in the household, even though Bessie sometimes harshly scolds Jane.\\nExcluded from the family activities, Jane is incredibly unhappy, with only a doll and books for comfort.\\nOne day, after her cousin John knocks her down and she attempts to defend herself, Jane is locked in the red room where her uncle died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost.\\nShe is subsequently attended to by the kindly apothecary, mr Lloyd, to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall.\\nHe recommends to mrs Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea mrs Reed happily supports.\\nmrs Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh mr Brocklehurst, director of Lowood Institution, a charity school for girls.\\nmrs Reed cautions mr Brocklehurst that Jane has a \"tendency for deceit\", which he interprets as her being a \"liar\".\\nBefore Jane leaves, however, she confronts mrs Reed and declares that she\\'ll never call her \"aunt\" again, that mrs Reed and her daughter, Georgiana, are the ones who are deceitful, and that she shall tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly mrs Reed treated her.\\nAt Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh, but she attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns, who is able to accept her punishment philosophically.\\nDuring a school inspection by mr Brocklehurst, Jane accidentally breaks her slate, thereby drawing attention to herself.\\nHe then stands her on a stool, brands her a liar, and shames her before the entire assembly.\\nJane is later comforted by her friend, Helen.\\nMiss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane\\'s self-defence and writes to mr Lloyd, whose reply agrees with Jane\\'s.\\nJane is then publicly cleared of mr Brocklehurst\\'s accusations.\\nThe 80 pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals, and thin clothing.\\nMany students fall ill when a typhus epidemic strikes, and Jane\\'s friend Helen dies of consumption in her arms.\\nWhen mr Brocklehurst\\'s maltreatment of the students is discovered, several benefactors erect a new building and install a sympathetic management committee to moderate mr Brocklehurst\\'s harsh rule.\\nConditions at the school then improve dramatically.\\nThe name Lowood symbolizes the \"low\" point in Jane\\'s life where she was maltreated.\\nHelen Burns is a representation of Charlotte\\'s elder sister Maria, who died of tuberculosis after spending time at a school where the children were mistreated.\\nAfter six years as a student and two as a teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave, like her friend and confidante Miss Temple, who recently married.\\nShe advertises her services as a governess and receives one reply, from Alice Fairfax, housekeeper at Thornfield Hall.\\nJane takes the position, teaching AdÃ¨le Varens, a young French girl.\\nOne night, while Jane is walking to a nearby town, a horseman passes her.\\nThe horse slips on ice and throws the rider.\\nDespite the rider\\'s surliness, Jane helps him to get back onto his horse.\\nLater, back at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house.\\nAdÃ¨le is his ward, left in his care when her mother abandoned her.\\nAt Jane\\'s first meeting with him within Thornfield, mr Rochester teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall.\\nHe also talks strangely in other ways, but Jane is able to give as good as she gets.\\nmr Rochester and Jane soon come to enjoy each other\\'s company, and spend many evenings together.\\nOdd things start to happen at the house, such as a strange laugh, a mysterious fire in mr Rochester\\'s room (from which Jane saves Rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him and the fire), and an attack on a house guest named mr Mason.\\nThen Jane receives word that her aunt mrs Reed is calling for her, because she suffered a stroke after her son John died.\\nJane returns to Gateshead and remains there for a month, attending to her dying aunt.\\nmrs Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, giving Jane a letter from Jane\\'s paternal uncle, mr John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir.\\nmrs Reed admits to telling mr Eyre that Jane had died of fever at Lowood.\\nSoon afterward, mrs Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.\\nBack at Thornfield, Jane broods over mr Rochester\\'s rumoured impending marriage to the beautiful and talented, but snobbish and heartless, Blanche Ingram.\\nHowever, one midsummer evening, Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married, but how she will soon forget him.\\nThe normally self-controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him.\\nRochester is then sure that Jane is sincerely in love with him, and he proposes marriage.\\nJane is at first sceptical of his sincerity, but eventually believes him and gladly agrees to marry him.\\nShe then writes to her Uncle John, telling him of her happy news.\\nAs she prepares for her wedding, Jane\\'s forebodings arise when a strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips her wedding veil in two.\\nAs with the previous mysterious events, mr Rochester attributes the incident to Grace Poole, one of his servants.\\nDuring the wedding ceremony, mr Mason and a lawyer declare that mr Rochester cannot marry because he is already married to mr Mason\\'s sister, Bertha.\\nmr Rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money.\\nOnce they were united, he discovered that she was rapidly descending into madness, and so he eventually locked her away in Thornfield, hiring Grace Poole as a nurse to look after her.\\nWhen Grace gets drunk, his wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at Thornfield.\\nIt turns out that Jane\\'s uncle, mr John Eyre, is a friend of mr Mason\\'s and was visited by him soon after mr Eyre received Jane\\'s letter about her impending marriage.\\nAfter the marriage ceremony is broken off, mr Rochester asks Jane to go with him to the south of France, and live with

far from Thornfield as she can using the little money she had previously saved.\\nShe accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on the coach and has to sleep on the moor, and unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food.\\nExhausted and hungry, she eventually makes her way to the home of Diana and Mary Rivers, but is turned away by the housekeeper.\\nShe

learns Jane\\'s true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of 20,000 pounds (equivalent to over Â£13 million in 2011).\\nWhen Jane questions him further, st John reveals that John Eyre is also his and his sisters\\' uncle.\\nThey had once hoped for a share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing.\\nJane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and Diana and Mary come back to live at Moor House.\\nThinking Jane will make a suitable missionary\\'s wife, st John asks her to marry him and to go with him to India, not out of love, but out of duty.\\nJane initially accepts going to India but rejects the marriage proposal,

she rebuffs him as well, in what might be considered a more gentle way.\\nSome days later Vosill receives a note from Adlain, asking her to meet him and two other Dukes elsewhere in the castle.\\nShe leaves alone, but Oelph opts to follow her in secret; after catching a glimpse of someone fleeing, he arrives in time to be arrested by the guard, who proceed to discover Vosill standing over the body of a murdered Duke, stabbed with one of her scalpels.\\nVosill and Oelph are almost immediately delivered to Ralinge, who binds the two separately and then strips, intending to rape, Vosill.\\nThe woman issues what sounds to Oelph like commands, albeit in a language he does not recognize even partially.\\nOelph\\'s eyes are closed at this point, and in his narrative he is unable to adequately describe what he hears next, other than an impression of wind and metal.\\nWhen he opens his eyes he finds Ralinge and his assistants dead, dispatched bloodily, and Vosill free and in the process of removing her bindings, no indication of how she was freed.\\nLater, she claims that Oelph fell unconscious and the three men fought over who would rape her first, though she indicates to him that this is what he \"should\" remember.\\nThe two are taken from the torturer\\'s chamber shortly thereafter, as the King has abruptly taken ill and appears to be dying.\\nVosill is able to cure King Quience\\'s condition, and is there to witness as the conspiracy against her is revealed to the King, inadvertently, when news of Ralinge\\'s death reaches the conspirators: Commander Adlain and Dukes Quettil and Ulresile.\\nUltimately the blame is publicly taken by Ulresile, who escapes with being exiled for several months; the King makes it clear that further plots against the doctor will not be tolerated.\\nBecause Oelph is not present for these events, his account comes second-hand from servants present; during this scene he reveals his master to be Guard Commander Adlain.\\nVosill requests the King release her from her duties, which he does.\\nShe leaves just a few days later on a ship for Drezen, and is seen off at the dock by Oelph.\\nOelph tries to suppress the urge to ask to accompany Vosill, since he knows that her answer will be in the negative, but in the end he does so anyway.\\nThe ship leaves sometime later, Vosill nowhere to be seen on board.\\nThe second, interleaved storyline is told by an initially unnamed narrator, remaining unnamed so as to provide a neutral context for the narrative.\\nThe story focuses on DeWar, bodyguard to General UrLeyn, the Prime Protector of the Protectorate of Tassasen.\\nProtector UrLeyn is the leader of Tassasen, having killed the previous monarch in a revolt; subsequently he eliminated official terms such as \"King\" and \"Empire\" within Tassasen.\\nAt the beginning of the story the Protectorate is fast approaching a war with the neighbouring land of Ladenscion, led by barons who initially supported UrLeyn\\'s revolution but now intend to establish themselves as independent.\\nDeWar is the sometimes-confidant of UrLeyn, but the bodyguard also maintains a friendly, conversational relationship with Perrund, a member of the Tassasen harem.\\nPerrund was once the Protector\\'s prized concubine, which changed following an assassination attempt on UrLeyn; Perrund shielded the Protector with her body, saving his life at the cost of crippling her left arm.\\nThough no longer as prized as a concubine, Perrund is highly regarded by UrLeyn, DeWar, and most of Tassasen society.\\nDeWar in particular finds her easy to confide in, and spends much of his off-time playing board games with her while the two tell each other stories.\\nDeWar is on high alert as the conflict with Ladenscion approaches, believing that someone within the court may be a traitor.\\nAn attempt is made on UrLeyn\\'s life by an assassin disguised as an ambassador, though DeWar anticipates the threat and kills the man before he can succeed.\\nNonetheless, this act only reinforces DeWar\\'s fears of a traitor.\\nA surprising, unwelcome turn comes when UrLeyn\\'s young son, Lattens, has a seizure and subsequently falls ill.\\nWhile the boy slowly recovers, DeWar tells him stories of a \"magical land\" called Lavishia, a place where \"every man was a king, every woman a queen\".\\nEventually the boy recovers, and UrLeyn and his bodyguard depart for the front lines, where the war with Ladenscion is flagging.\\nHowever, no sooner are they there than word arrives that Lattens has fallen ill again, prompting a distraught UrLeyn to rush back to the castle.\\nWhile DeWar is gone, Perrund tells Lattens a story about a girl named Dawn, who spent most of her life locked in a basement by her cruel family and was eventually rescued by a travelling circus.\\nWhen he returns, Perrund tells DeWar about the story, then tells him it was a shadow of the real story: her story.\\nRather than her parents locking her in the basement to be cruel, they locked her in to hide her from Imperial soldiersâ\\x80\\x94high-ranking men of the former King\\'s regime.\\nRather than being rescued, the soldiers found her, raped her, her mother and her sisters, and then forced her to watch as they murdered her father and brothers.\\nThe soldiers were eventually killed, but Perrund still feels she is now dead inside.\\nDeWar attempts to in some way comfort her, but she quickly demands he return her to the harem.\\nLattens\\' condition continues to worsen, causing UrLeyn to act more and more erratically, spending less time focusing on the war and more time at his son\\'s bedside.\\nThe Protector goes so far as to bar all visitors to his chambers, and even prohibits DeWar from speaking to him unless he is spoken to.\\nHis only real contact is with Perrund, who spends most nights holding UrLeyn as he cries himself to sleep.\\nDeWar enlists Perrund\\'s help in focusing UrLeyn on the war, but to no success.\\nAn epiphany strikes DeWar when he finds he has drooled on his pillow in his sleep, and he proceeds to Lattens\\' room.\\nA guard restrains the boy\\'s nurse while DeWar examines his comforter, finding it has been soaked in an unknown fluid, presumably poison.\\nUnder threat of death the nurse reveals who has been orchestrating the poisoning: Perrund.\\nDeWar storms into the harem chambers, intent on revealing the conspiracy to UrLeyn, but arrives too late; Perrund has already killed the Protector, and calmly waits for the bodyguard.\\nHolding her at sword-point, DeWar tearfully demands to know why she conspired against the Protector.\\nPerrund replies that she did it for revenge, for killing her and her family.\\nThe soldiers who raped her were not the former King\\'s men at all, not even men allied to UrLeyn, but the man himself, as well as his current, closest advisers.\\nAfterwards she was taken in by men from Haspidus, and recruited as a spy by King Quience directly.\\nSaving UrLeyn from the assassin was simply to prevent him from dying while he was a strong leader; instead, her orders were to ensure he died in \"utter ruin\".\\nAfter her confession, Perrund demands DeWar kill her.\\nHe silently refuses, lowering his sword.\\nPerrund grabs his knife and brings it to her own throat, but it is quickly knocked away by DeWar\\'s blade, which he lowers once more.\\nOelph gives a brief, personal epilogue for both stories.\\nThe three conspirators who attempted to kill Vosill died of various diseases, only Adlain lasting longer than a few years.\\nKing Quience reigned for forty years before his death, and was succeeded by one of his many daughters, giving the kingdom its first ruling Queen.\\nVosill disappeared from the ship she departed on; her disappearance was only discovered after a sudden burst of wind and chain-fire struck the ship, then vanished as quickly.\\nAttempts to notify Vosill\\'s family in Drezen were unsuccessful: nobody in the island country could be found who had ever met her.\\nOelph himself became a doctor, eventually taking Vosill\\'s post as the royal physician.\\nTassasen endured a civil war after the death of Protector UrLeyn; eventually King Lattens took control of the Empire, ruling it quietly.\\nOelph explains that he stopped DeWar\\'s story as he did because that is where versions of the story differ dramatically.\\nThe more popular version has DeWar personally execute Perrund, followed by a return to the Half-Hidden Kingdoms where he reclaims his hidden title as Prince, and eventually King.\\nA second version, supposedly written by Perrund herself, instead has DeWar telling the waiting guards and staff that UrLeyn is fine but sleeping, this and other distractions providing enough time for him and the former concubine to flee Tassasen before the Protector\\'s body is discovered.\\nThe two elude capture and arrive in the Half-Hidden Kingdoms, eventually marry, have several children, and die many years later in an avalanche in the mountains.\\nFinally, Oelph ends his epilogue by revealing that he expects his wife, whom he loves dearly, to return soon, quite possibly with his grandchildren accompanying her.\\n',\n",

who lives with and resembles dr Sarton.\\nEnderby orders Sammy to bring a blaster through the unmonitored \\'open air\\' (something that no Earthman could countenance), but in the heat of the moment Enderby drops his glasses and fails to distinguish between the human and robot, accidentally shooting the human.\\nKnowing that Baley\\'s wife is also a Medievalist, he assigns Baley to the case, working with Daneel who represents the Spacers, and spreads a rumour about humanoid robots amongst the subversives to throw suspicion on Baley when Enderby later destroys Sammy with radiation.\\nFurthermore, Daneel rules out Enderby as the murderer as his brain patterns show him incapable of deliberately killing.\\nThe novel follows Baley and Olivaw as Baley begins to suspect Olivaw but is proved wrong twice.\\nOlivaw gradually learns more about Earth humans and starts to display curiosity in aspects of human behaviour and Earth technology.\\nAs part of the investigation, Baley makes a visit to Spacetown where he meets with dr Falstofe, who injects him with a mildly suggestive drug while speaking about the relative merits and shortcomings of Earth and Spacer society.\\nBaley is converted to the cause of spreading humanity throughout the galaxy.\\nAlthough the Spacers deem Baley inadequate to convert enough Earthmen, they find their target when Baley arrests Clousarr on suspicion of inciting a riot and Olivaw provides him with suggestive statements.\\nTheir job accomplished, the Spacers make plans to leave Earth as their continued presence would be to the detriment of their cause and accept dr Sarton\\'s unsolved death as a necessary sacrifice; this leaves Baley with 90 minutes to find the killer which he is convinced will also clear him of the destruction of Sammy.\\nBaley has a flash of inspiration when he connects Enderby\\'s emotional highs and lows to how close or far away Baley was to solving the murder, and obtaining a recording of the crime scene, manages to demonstrate that fragments of Enderby\\'s glasses remain in situ.\\nGiven that the Spacers have already accepted that Sarton\\'s death is unsolved, they are willing to not prosecute Enderby for the accident if he agrees to work with them to promote colonization of other worlds amongst the Medievalists.\\n',\n",

but Bliss deflects the transduction at the moment Bander uses it as a weapon, accidentally killing Bander.\\nWhile escaping, they acquire Bander\\'s immature child, Fallom, in a state of panic because its robotic nursemaid, like all other robots on the estate, has lost power and stopped functioning due to the death of its master, and carry her (Bliss, by preference, uses a feminine pronoun on Fallom) aboard their ship to prevent her execution by the Solarians as she would be surplus to their population requirements - a more mature child would be chosen to take over Bander\\'s estate.\\nThe crew now visit Melpomenia, the third and final Spacer coordinate they have, where the atmosphere has become reduced to a few thousandths of normal atmospheric pressure.\\nWearing space suits, they enter a library, and find a plaque listing the names and coordinates of all fifty Spacer worlds.\\nOn the way back to the ship, they notice a moss has begun to grow around the seals of their space suits, and just in time, surmise that the moss is feeding on miniscule leakages of carbon dioxide.\\nThus, they are able to eradicate the moss with a blaster and heavy UV-illumination so that no spores are unintentionally carried off the planet.\\nThey then plot the Spacer worlds on the ship\\'s map, which form a rough sphere and conclude that the location of Earth must be near to the center of the sphere.\\nThis area turns out to have a binary star system.\\nThey arrive on Alpha Centauri, which is all ocean except for an island 250&nbsp;km long and 65&nbsp;km wide on which live a small group of humans.\\nIn a reference to the radioactive Earth of Asimov\\'s novel Pebble in the Sky, the restoration of Earth\\'s soil was eventually abandoned in favour of resettling the population to \"New Earth\", which the First Galactic Empire had already been terraforming.\\nThe natives appear friendly, but secretly intend to kill the visitors with a microbiological agent, to prevent them from informing the rest of the galaxy of their existence.\\nThey are warned to escape before the agent can be activated, by a native woman who has formed an attraction to Trevize and was impressed by Fallom\\'s ability to play a flute with just her mind.\\nNow certain that Alpha Centauri is not Earth but near it, they approach a system close by, and are puzzled by the very strong similarities between this star and the larger sun of the Alpha Centauri system.\\nAsimov here is drawing attention to an astronomical curiosity: the nearest star system to Sol contains a star that has the same spectral type, G2 V, though Alpha Centauri A is a little larger and brighter.\\nOn the approach to Earth, they detect it to be highly radioactive and not capable of supporting life; but, while trying to use the ship\\'s computer to locate Solaria, Fallom calls Trevize\\'s attention upon the moon, which is large enough to serve as a hideout for the forces that lived on Earth.\\nThere, they find Daneel Olivaw, who explains he has been paternalistically manipulating humanity since Elijah Baley\\'s time, long before the Galactic Empire or Foundation: thus having caused the settlement of Alpha Centauri, the creation of Gaia, and the creation of psychohistory (detailed in Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation), and manipulated Trevize into making his decision at the end of Foundation\\'s Edge (although he did not manipulate the decision itself).\\nIt is revealed that Daneel\\'s positronic brain is deteriorating, and he is unable to design a new brain;

              " 502: 'Prelude to Foundation opens on the planet Trantor, the empire\\'s capital planet, the day after Hari Seldon has given a speech at a conference.\\nSeveral parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history).\\nSeldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile.\\nOver the course of the book, Seldon and Dors Venabili, a female companion, are taken from location to location by an aide, Chetter Hummin, who introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor.\\nThroughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science.\\nEven if feasible, it may take several decades to develop.\\nHummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory.\\nEventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming, then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy.\\nEight years after the events of Prelude, Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale.\\nHis notability and fame increase and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor.\\nAs the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age.\\nHaving worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation.\\nCalled forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling.\\nIf humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second Empire arises.\\nHowever, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled Encyclopedia Galactica.\\nThe board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the \"Encyclopedists\" be exiled to a remote planet, Terminus.\\nSeldon agrees to set up his own collection of Encyclopedists, and also secretly implements a contingency planâ\\x80\\x94a second Foundationâ\\x80\\x94at the \"opposite end\" of the galaxy.\\nOnce on Terminus, the inhabitants find themselves at a loss.\\nWith four powerful planets surrounding their own, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence.\\nThe Mayor of Terminus City, Salvor Hardin, proposes to play the planets against each other.\\nHis plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he is promoted to Mayor of Terminus (the planet).\\nMeanwhile, the minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire\\'s equivalents.\\nUsing its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity.\\nThe interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets.\\nOne such trader, Hober Mallow, becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the seat of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation\\'s reach.\\nThe current Emperor of the Galaxy perceives the Foundation as a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire\\'s still-mighty fleet of war vessels.\\nHowever, eventually convinced, as foretold by psychohistory, that his power would be most vulnerable to that of his own successful general (a possible analogy with that of the Roman empire at various times), the Emperor finally orders withdrawal of his fleet.\\nIn spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor and the Empire itself is defeated.\\nMore than a century later, an unknown outsider called the Mule has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation at a rapid pace.\\nWhen the Foundation comes to realize the Mule was not foreseen in Seldon\\'s plan, and there is no predicted way of defeating him, Toran and Bayta Darell, accompanied by Ebling Misâ\\x80\\x94the galaxy\\'s current greatest psychologistâ\\x80\\x94and a court jester named Magnifico (whom they agree to protect, as his life is under threat from the Mule himself), set out to find the Second Foundation, hoping they bring an end to the Mule\\'s reign.\\nEventually, working in the still-functional Great Library of Trantor, Mis comes to learn of the Second Foundation\\'s whereabouts.\\nMis also deduces that the Mule\\'s success stems from his mutation; he is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him.\\nHaving worked out that the Mule is also attempting to find the location of the Second Foundation, Bayta Darell kills Mis before he can reveal where the Second Foundation is.\\nBayta explains that she regrets her actions, but that the secret had to be kept from the Mule at all costs.\\nMagnifico reveals that Bayta\\'s suspicions about him are correct and that he is the Mule and has been laboring to find the Second Foundation in order to start his own Second Empire, hundreds of years before the Seldon Plan is to be complete.\\nDismayed at having made a mistake which allowed Bayta to see through his disguise, he leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his own search.\\nAs the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes briefly out of hiding to face the threat directly.\\nIt is revealed to be a collection of the most intelligent humans in the galaxy, the descendants of Seldon\\'s psychohistorians.\\nWhile the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing the mental sciences.\\nUsing the might of its strongest minds, the Second Foundation ultimately wears down the Mule.\\nHis destructive attitude is adjusted to a benevolent one.\\nHe returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.\\nThe first Foundation, learning of the implications of the Second, who will be the true inheritor of Seldon\\'s promised future Empire, greatly resents itâ\\x80\\x94and seeks to find and destroy it, believing it can manage without it.\\nAfter many attempts to unravel the only clue Seldon had given as to the Second Foundation\\'s whereabouts (\"at Star\\'s End\"), the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus.\\nBy developing a technology which causes great pain to telepaths, the Foundation uncover a group of 50 of them, and destroys them, believing it has thereby won.\\nHowever, the Second Foundation has planned for this eventuality, and has sent 50 of its members to their deaths as martyrs to preserve its anonymity.\\nAt the very end, the Second Foundation is revealed to be located on the former Imperial Homeworld of Trantor itself.\\nThe clue \"at Star\\'s End\" was not a physical clue, but instead based on an old saying, \"All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end\".\\nSeldon, being a social scientist and not a physical one, placed the two Foundations at \"opposite ends\" of the galaxy, but not in a physical sense.\\nFoundation was located on Terminus, out in the Periphery of the galaxy, where the Empire\\'s influence was minimal.\\nSecond Foundation was hidden on Trantor, where, even in its dying days, the Empire\\'s power and culture was strongest.\\nBelieving the Second Foundation still exists (despite the common belief that it has been extinguished), a young politician Golan Trevize is sent by the current Mayor of the Foundation, Harla Branno, to uncover the group while accompanied by a scholar named Janov Pelorat.\\nThe reason for their belief is the Seldon Plan appears to be proceeding fully on course, despite all the disruptions caused by the Mule.\\nThey attribute this fact to unknown interventions by the Second Foundation.\\nAfter a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe the Second Foundation lies on the mythical planet of Earth.\\nNo such planet exists in any database, yet several myths and legends all refer to it, and it is Trevize\\'s idea that the planet is deliberately being kept hidden.\\nMeanwhile, Stor Gendibal, a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers a simple localâ\\x80\\x94who lives on the same planet as the Second Foundationâ\\x80\\x94has had a minor alteration made to her mind.\\nThis alteration is far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do and, as a result, he determines a greater force of Mentalics is operating in the Galaxyâ\\x80\\x94a force as powerful as the Mule himself.\\nHaving shown interest in Trevize earlier (as he is an individual who has spoken out against the Second Foundation frequently), Gendibal endeavors to follow Trevize, reasoning that he could find out who has altered the mind of the native.\\nUsing the few scraps of reliable information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, to such an extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind.\\nBoth Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time.\\nGaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best.\\nTrevize\\'s purpose, faced with the leaders of both foundations and Gaia, is to be trusted to make the best decision between the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation\\'s path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (ie, empire), the Second Foundation\\'s path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control, or Gaia\\'s path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part.\\nAfter Trevize makes his decision for Gaia\\'s path, the intellect of Gaia adjusts both Branno and Glendibal\\'s minds so that each believe they have succeeded in a significant task (Branno believes she has successfully negotiated a treaty tying Sayshell to the Foundation, and Gendibal believes that the Second Foundation is victorious and should continue as normal).\\nTrevize remains, but is uncertain as to why he has intuited that Gaia is the correct outcome for the future.\\nStill uncertain about his decision, Trevize continues on with the search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss).\\nEventually, Trevize finds three sets of co-ordinates which are very old.\\nAdjusting them for time, he realises that his ship\\'s computer does not list any planet in the vicinity of the co-ordinates.\\nWhen he physically visits each location, he discovers an uncharted planet: Aurora, Solaria, and finally Melpomenia.\\nAfter searching and facing different dilemmas on each planet, none has given him the answers he seeks.\\nAurora and Melpomenia are long deserted, but Solaria contains a small population which is extremely advanced in the field of Mentalics.\\nWhen their lives are threatened, Bliss uses her abilities (and the shared intellect of Gaia) to destroy the Solarian who is about to kill them.\\nThis leaves behind a small child, who will be put to death if left alone, so Bliss makes the decision to keep the child as they quickly escape the planet.\\nEventually, Trevize discovers Earth, but it, again, contains no satisfactory answers for him (it is also long-since deserted).\\nHowever, it dawns on Trevize that the answer may not be on Earth, but on Earth\\'s satelliteâ\\x80\\x94the Moon.\\nUpon approaching the planet, they are drawn closer and then to inside the Moon\\'s core, where they meet a robot named Daneel Olivaw.\\nOlivaw explains that he has been guiding human history for thousands of years, and this is the reason the Seldon plan had remained on course, despite the interventions by the Mule.\\nOlivaw also states he is at the end of his run-time and, despite replacement parts and more advanced brains (which contain 20,000 years of memories), he is going to die shortly.\\nHe explains that no robotic brain can be developed to replace his current one, and to continue assisting with the benefit of humanityâ\\x80\\x94which may come under attack by beings from beyond our Galaxyâ\\x80\\x94he must meld his mind with an organic intellect.\\nOnce again, Trevize is put in the position of deciding if having Olivaw meld with the child\\'s superior intellect would be in the best interests of the galaxy.\\nThe decision is left ambiguous (though likely a \\'yes\\') as it is also implied that the melding of the minds may be to the child\\'s benefit and that she may have sinister intentions about it.\\n',\n",

Barnard, because he is really Chalmers Bryant (wanted by the police for stock fraud) and because he is keen to develop the gold-mines in the valley; and Conway, because the contemplative scholarly life suits him.\\nA seemingly young Manchu woman, Lo-Tsen, is another postulant at the lamasery.\\nShe does not speak English but plays the harpsichord.\\nMallinson falls in love with her, as does Conway, though more languidly.\\nConway is given an audience with the High Lama, an unheard-of honor.\\nHe learns that the lamasery was constructed in its present form by a Catholic monk named Perrault from Luxembourg, in the early eighteenth century.\\nThe lamasery has since then been joined by others who have found their way into the valley.\\nOnce they have done so, their ageing slows; if they then leave the valley, they age quickly and die.\\nConway guesses correctly that the High Lama is Perrault, now 250 years old.\\nIn a later audience, the High Lama reveals that he is finally dying and that he wants Conway to lead the lamasery.\\nMallinson has arranged to leave the valley with porters and Lo-Tsen.\\nThey are waiting for him 5 kilometers outside the valley but he cannot traverse the dangerous route by himself, so he convinces Conway to go along and assist him.\\nThis ends Rutherford\\'s manuscript.\\nThe last time Rutherford saw Conway, it appeared he was preparing to make his way back to Shangri-La.\\nRutherford completes his account by telling the neurologist that he attempted to track Conway and verify some of his claims of Shangri-La.\\nHe found the Chung-Kiang doctor who had treated Conway.\\nThe doctor said Conway had been brought in by a Chinese woman who was ill and died soon after.\\nShe was old, the doctor had told Rutherford, \"Most old of anyone I have ever seen\", implying that it was Lo-Tsen, aged drastically by her departure from Shangri-La.\\n',\n",

childlike behavior and why they had to escape from Weed.\\nEventually, George eases the tensions by telling Lennie his favorite story about their future farm before going to sleep.\\nThe next day, they arrive at the ranch near Soledad.\\nThey meet Candy (Roman Bohnen), the aged, one-handed ranch-hand with his ageing dog he raised since he was a puppy.\\nAfter meeting with the ranch boss, Jackson (Oscar O\\'Shea), the pair are confronted by Curley, the small-statured jealous and violent son of the ranch owner, who threatens to beat Lennie to a pulp because of his height, as Curley has a huge hatred against men who are of large stature.\\nTo make matters worse, Curley\\'s seductive, yet sadistic and conniving wife, Mae (Betty Field), to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, flirts with the other ranch hands.\\nGeorge orders Lennie not to look at, or even talk to, her, as he senses the troubles that Mae could bring to the men.\\nOne night, Mae enters the barn in an attempt to talk with Slim (Charles Bickford).\\nEven when Mae explains how her life has been during the Depression, Slim refuses to listen to her and shuns her, saying \"You got no troubles, except what you bring on yourself\" and tells her to go back to the house.\\nWhen this statement causes Mae to sob, Slim is forced to give in and let her talk.\\nBack at the bunkhouse, Candy offers to join with George and Lennie after Carlson kills his dog, so they can buy the farm and the dream appears to move closer to reality.\\nCurley appears and makes a scene in the bunkhouse as the workers mock him after he accused Slim of keeping company with his wife.\\nGeorge and Lennie\\'s dream is over-shadowed when Curley catches Lennie laughing, grabs him from his bunk and starts punching him in the face repeatedly.\\nInstead of fighting back, Lennie asks for help from George, who tells him to fight back.\\nUpon hearing George say this, Lennie catches Curley\\'s hand and crushes it, not letting go until he finds out what he did.\\nSlim gives Curley an ultimatum: not to tell anyone what exactly happened.\\nIf Curley does tell his father in retribution to get Lennie and George fired, Slim will tell everyone what happened.\\nCurley is told, for this reason, to say that he got his hand caught in a piece of machinery.\\nOn Saturday night, everyone, except Lennie, Candy and Crooks (Leigh Whipper) (because of his race), are in town, enjoying themselves.\\nCrooks asks Lennie to stay in his room and Lennie explains to him about the farm that he, George and Candy are going to own, forgetting his promise to George not to tell this to anyone.\\nCandy gets into the conversation too, and when George comes back first, he sees Lennie smoking a cigar and takes it away, guessing what Lennie had done.\\nAt that moment, Mae enters the bunkhouse, trying to ask Crooks who crushed Curley\\'s hand.\\nWhen Crooks refuses to respond, Mae callously calls the four \"bindlestiffs\" in an attempt to belittle them.\\nWhen Candy responds with proof of what they are going to do in the future, Mae refuses to accept their American dream, calling him an \"old goat\".\\nWhen Mae tries to get Crooks to explain what happened to Curley\\'s hand (despite the fact that he was not present), George mentions that nobody did it, briefly leading Mae to believe that George was the one who crushed his hand.\\nGeorge tries to explain what they are going to do in the future, and that, if Mae keeps constantly flirting with them, she is going to cause the dream to crash.\\nThe callous Mae refuses to listen, and, while looking for the person who crushed her husband\\'s hand, sees Lennie\\'s bloodied and bruised face, and she finds out that he is the one responsible.\\nWhen Mae tries to be kind to Lennie and to \"thank\" him for what he did, George grabs her by the shoulder, berates her and tells her to return to the house.\\nMae refuses to do so, saying that she has the right to talk to and flirt with whomever she comes across.\\nJackson, who happened to be standing by Crooks\\' door, catches George with his hand raised, with the intention to slap Mae across the face because of her arrogance and negligence.\\nHolding a horsewhip in his hand, Jackson silently dissuades him from doing so and to let Mae go back to the house unharmed.\\nThe next morning, Mae confronts Curley, who repeats the same statement Slim gave him earlier, but because Mae knows the truth, she taunts him, calling him \"a punk with a crippled hand.\\n\" The aggravated Curley then tells her that their marriage is over, and that she is going to be kicked out of the ranch due to her carnal behavior with the ranch hands.\\nShe continues to laugh hysterically until she starts to weep, realizing she is now done for.\\nBefore she can leave, Mae enters the barn to pet a few of Slim\\'s puppies, when she spots Lennie sobbing, after he killed his puppy stroking it too hard.\\nWhen Lennie tries to leave, knowing he should not be talking to Mae as ordered by George, she stops him from leaving and forces him to talk to her.\\nBecause there is a horseshoe tournament going on until dusk, Mae plans to talk with him until then.\\nMae explains to Lennie what she wanted to be before Curley shattered her dream.\\nWhen Lennie tells Mae that he loves to stroke soft things, Mae allows him to stroke her hair, telling him not to \"muss it up\".\\nMae starts to resist and scream when Lennie strokes her hair too hard.\\nHowever, when Lennie tries to silence Mae, he accidentally kills her by recklessly breaking her neck unintentionally.\\nThis incidental situation crashes their own American dream.\\nWhen Candy and George find Mae\\'s body, they tell the others, including Curley, who grows infuriated.\\nAs a result, a lynch mob gathers to kill Lennie.\\nHowever, George and Slim go off alone to find Lennie.\\nGeorge tells Slim that he has Carlson\\'s Luger after he and Candy see Mae\\'s dead body.\\nGeorge and Slim separate and go off to find Lennie.\\nGeorge finds him first and, realizing he is doomed to a life of loneliness and despair like the rest of the migrant workers, wants to spare Lennie a painful death at the hands of the furious and cold-hearted Curley.\\nAfter giving Lennie one last retelling of their dream of buying their own land, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head with Carlson\\'s Luger before the mob can find him.\\nWhen the mob arrives too late, only Slim realizes what George has done, and hands the Luger to a local police officer as they leave the river.\\n',\n",

              " 600: 'As early as September 1942 von Stauffenberg was considering Hans Georg Schmidt von Altenstadt , author of Unser Weg zum Meer, as a replacement for Hitler.\\nFrom the beginning of September 1943 until 20 July 1944, von Stauffenberg was the driving force behind the plot to assassinate Hitler and take control of Germany.\\nHis resolve, organisational abilities, and radical approach put an end to inactivity caused by doubts and long discussions on whether military virtues had been made obsolete by Hitler\\'s behaviour.\\nWith the help of his friend Henning von Tresckow, he united the conspirators and drove them into action.\\nStauffenberg was aware that, under German law, he was committing high treason.\\nHe openly told young conspirator Axel von dem Bussche in late 1943, \"ich betreibe mit allen mir zur VerfÃ¼gung stehenden Mitteln den Hochverrat.\\n\".\\n(\"I am committing high treason with all means at my disposal.\\n\".\\n).\\nHe justified himself to Bussche by referring to the right under natural law (\"Naturrecht\") to defend millions of people\\'s lives from the criminal aggressions of Hitler.\\nOnly after the conspirator General Helmuth Stieff on 7 July 1944 had declared himself unable to assassinate Hitler on a uniforms display at Klessheim castle near Salzburg, Stauffenberg decided to personally kill Hitler and to run the plot in Berlin.\\nBy then, Stauffenberg had great doubts about the possibility of success.\\nTresckow convinced him to go on with it even if it had no chance of success at all, \"The assassination must be attempted.\\nEven if it fails, we must take action in Berlin\", as this would be the only way to prove to the world that the Hitler regime and Germany were not one and the same and that not all Germans supported the regime.\\nStauffenberg\\'s part in the original plan required him to stay at the BendlerstraÃ\\x9fe offices in Berlin, so he could phone regular army units all over Europe in an attempt to convince them to arrest leaders of Nazi political organisations such as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and the Gestapo.\\nUnfortunately, when General Helmuth Stieff, Chief of Operation at Army High Command, who had regular access to Hitler, backtracked from his earlier commitment to assassinate Hitler, Stauffenberg was forced to take on two critical roles: kill Hitler far from Berlin and trigger the military machine in Berlin during office hours of the very same day.\\nBeside Stieff, he was the only conspirator who had regular access to Hitler (during his briefings) by mid-1944, as well as being the only officer among the conspirators thought to have the resolve and persuasiveness to convince German military leaders to throw in with the coup once Hitler was dead.\\nThis requirement greatly reduced the chance of a successful coup.\\nAfter several unsuccessful tries by Stauffenberg to meet Hitler, GÃ¶ring and Himmler when they were together, he went ahead with the attempt at Wolfsschanze on 20 July 1944.\\nStauffenberg entered the briefing room carrying a briefcase containing two small bombs.\\nThe location had unexpectedly been changed from the subterranean FÃ¼hrerbunker to Albert Speer\\'s wooden barrack/hut due to it being a hot summer\\'s day.\\nHe left the room to arm the first bomb with specially adapted pliers, a task made difficult because he had lost his right hand and had only three fingers on his left.\\nA guard knocked and opened the door, urging him to hurry as the meeting was about to begin.\\nAs a result, Stauffenberg was able to arm only one of the bombs.\\nHe left the second bomb with his aide-de-camp, Werner von Haeften, and returned to the briefing room, where he placed the briefcase under the conference table, as close as he could to Hitler.\\nSome minutes later, he excused himself and left the room.\\nAfter his exit, the briefcase was moved by Colonel Heinz Brandt.\\nWhen the explosion tore through the hut, Stauffenberg was convinced that no one in the room could have survived.\\nAlthough four people were killed and almost all survivors were injured, Hitler himself was shielded from the blast by the heavy, solid-oak conference table leg and was only slightly wounded.\\nStauffenberg and Haeften quickly left and drove to the nearby airfield.\\nAfter his return to Berlin, Stauffenberg immediately began to motivate his friends to initiate the second phase: the military coup against the Nazi leaders.\\nWhen Joseph Goebbels announced by radio that Hitler had survived and later, after Hitler himself personally spoke on the state radio, the conspirators realised that the coup had failed.\\nThey were tracked to their Bendlerstrasse offices and overpowered after a brief shoot-out, during which Stauffenberg was wounded in the shoulder.\\nIn an attempt to save his own life, co-conspirator Generaloberst Friedrich Fromm, Commander-in-Chief of the Replacement Army present in the Bendlerblock (Headquarters of the Army), charged other conspirators in an impromptu court martial and condemned the ringleaders of the conspiracy to death.\\nColonel Claus von Stauffenberg, his aide 1st Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, General Friedrich Olbricht, and Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim were executed before 1:00 in the morning (21 July 1944) by a makeshift firing squad in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, which was lit by the headlights of a truck.\\nStauffenberg was third in line to be executed, with Lieutenant von Haeften after.\\nHowever, when it was Stauffenberg\\'s turn, Lieutenant von Haeften placed himself between the firing squad and Stauffenberg, and received the bullets meant for Stauffenberg.\\nWhen his turn came, Stauffenberg spoke his last words, \"Es lebe unser heiliges Deutschland.\\n\" (\"Long live our sacred Germany.\\n\") Others say the last words were: \"Es lebe das geheime Deutschland.\\n\" (\"Long live the secret Germany.\\n\") Fromm ordered that the executed officers (his former co-conspirators) receive an immediate burial with military honours in the Alter st-MatthÃ¤us-Kirchhof in Berlin\\'s SchÃ¶neberg district.\\nThe next day, however, Stauffenberg\\'s body was exhumed by the SS, stripped of his medals and insignia, and cremated.\\nStauffenberg\\'s family had already fled the country.\\nAnother central figure in the plot was Stauffenberg\\'s eldest brother, Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg.\\nOn 10 August 1944, Berthold was tried before Judge-President Roland Freisler in the special \"People\\'s Court\" (Volksgerichtshof).\\nThis court was established by Hitler for political offences.\\nBerthold was one of eight conspirators executed by slow strangulation (reputedly with piano wire used as the garrote) in PlÃ¶tzensee Prison, Berlin, later that day.\\nBefore he was killed, Berthold was strangled and then revived multiple times.\\nThe entire execution and multiple resuscitations were filmed for Hitler to view at his leisure.\\nMore than 200 were condemned in show trials and executed.\\nHitler used the 20 July Plot as an excuse to destroy anyone he feared would oppose him.\\nThe traditional military salute was replaced with the Nazi salute also known as the Hitler salute.\\nEventually, over 20,000 Germans were killed or sent to concentration camps in the purge.\\n',\n",
              " 601: 'The extent of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel\\'s involvement in the military\\'s resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive and limited documentation on the conspirators\\' plans and preparations exists.\\nThus, Rommel\\'s participation remains ambiguous and the perception of it largely has its source in the subsequent events (especially Rommel\\'s forced suicide) and the accounts by surviving participants.\\nAccording to a post-war account by Karl StrÃ¶lin, the OberbÃ¼rgermeister of Stuttgart at that time, he and two other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von StÃ¼lpnagel began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler conspiracy in early 1944.\\nOn 15 April 1944 Rommel\\'s new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to StÃ¼lpnagel.\\nSpeidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, but not to the plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only came to the attention of Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel\\'s headquarters.\\nThe conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty.\\nWitzelben was a field marshal, but had not been on active duty since 1942.\\nThe conspirators gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle.\\nSpeidel met with former foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath and StrÃ¶lin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel\\'s request, although the latter was not present.\\nNeurath and StrÃ¶lin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations in the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations.\\nAround the same timeframe, however, the plotters in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had reportedly decided to take part in the conspiracy.\\nOn 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom they hoped to negotiate with the Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.\\nThree days before the assassination attempt, on 17 July, Rommel\\'s staff car was strafed by an Allied aircraft in France; he was hospitalised with major injuries and incapacitated on 20 July.\\nRommel opposed assassinating Hitler.\\nAfter the war, his widow maintained that he believed an assassination attempt would spark a civil war.\\nAccording to journalist and author William Shirer, Rommel knew about the conspiracy and advocated that Hitler be arrested and placed on trial.\\nThe historian Ian Becket argues that \"there is no credible evidence that Rommel had more than limited and superficial knowledge of the plot\" and concludes that he would not have acted to aid the plotters in the aftermath of the attempt on 20 July, while the historian Ralf Georg Reuth contends that \"there was no indication of any active participation of Rommel in the conspiracy\".\\nHistorian Richard Evans concluded that he knew of a plot, but was not involved.\\nWhat is not debated are the results of the failed bomb plot of 20 July.\\nMany conspirators were arrested and the dragnet expanded to thousands.\\nConsequently, it did not take long for Rommel to come under suspicion.\\nHe was primarily implicated through his connection to Kluge.\\nRommel\\'s name also came up in forced confessions by StÃ¼lpnagel and Hofacker, and was included in Goerdeler\\'s papers on a list of potential supporters.\\nHitler knew it would cause a major scandal on the home front to have the popular Rommel publicly branded as a traitor.\\nWith this in mind, he opted to give Rommel the option of suicide via cyanide or a public trial by Freisler\\'s People\\'s Court.\\nRommel was well aware that being hauled before the People\\'s Court was tantamount to a death sentence.\\nHe also knew that if he chose to stand trial, his family would have been severely punished even before the all-but-certain conviction and execution.\\nWith this in mind, he committed suicide on 14 October 1944.\\nHe was buried with full military honours and his family was spared from persecution; his cause of death did not come to light until after the war.\\nInvolvement of the plotters in war crimes and atrocities has been studied by historians such as Christian Gerlach.\\nGerlach proved that plotters like Tresckow or Gersdorff were aware of mass murder happening in the East from at least 1941.\\nHe writes: \"Especially with reference to the murder of the Jews, [it is said that] \\'the SS\\' had deceived the officers by killing in secret, filing incomplete reports or none at all; if general staff offices protested, the SS threatened them\".\\nGerlach concludes: \"This is, of course, nonsense\".\\nTresckow also \"signed orders for the deportation of thousands of orphaned children for forced labor in the Reich\" (the so-called Heu-Aktion).\\nSuch actions lead historians to question the motives of the plotters, which seemed more concerned with the military situation than with Nazi atrocities and German war crimes.\\nHowever some others assert that, in such actions, Tresckow had to act out of principle to continue with his coup plans.\\nGerlach pointed out that the plotters had \"selective moral criteria\" and while they were concerned about Jews being exterminated in the Holocaust, they were far less disturbed about mass murder of civilians in the East.\\nTo Gerlach, the primary motivation of the plotters was to ensure German victory in the war or at least not to lose it.\\nGerlach\\'s arguments were later supported by historian Hans Mommsen, who stated that the plotters were interested above all in military victory.\\nBut Gerlach\\'s arguments were also criticized by some scholars, among them Peter Hoffmann from McGill University and Klaus Jochen Arnold from the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung.\\nThe overall goals towards Poland were mixed within the plotters.\\nMost of the plotters found it desirable to restore the old German borders from 1914, while others pointed out that the demands were unrealistic and amendments had to be made.\\nSome like Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg even saw all of Poland annexed to Germany.\\nTo Poland, which was fighting as an ally with both its army and government in exile, the vast territorial demands and traditional nationalistic visions of resistance made the plotters lose all credibility, and Poles saw little difference between them and racist policies of Hitler.\\nStauffenberg, as one of the leaders of the plot, stated five years before the coup in 1939 during the Poland campaign about Poles and Poland: \"It is essential that we begin a systemic colonisation in Poland.\\nBut I have no fear that this will not occur\".\\n',\n",
              " 602: 'Ishmael begins with a newspaper ad: \"Teacher seeks pupil.\\nMust have an earnest desire to save the world.\\nApply in person\".\\nThe nameless narrator and protagonist begins his story, telling how he first reacted to this ad with scorn because of the absurdity of \"wanting to save the world,\" a notion he feels that once he foolishly embraced himself as an adolescent during the counterculture movement of the 1960s.\\nHowever, he responds to the ad anyway and, upon arriving at the address, finds himself in a room with a gorilla.\\nHe notices a polysemous sign that reads \"With man gone, will there be hope for gorilla.\\n\"  To the narrator\\'s surprise, he finds that the gorilla, calling himself Ishmael, can communicate telepathically.\\nAt first baffled by this, the man learns the story of how the gorilla came to be here and soon accepts Ishmael as his teacher, regularly returning to Ishmael\\'s office throughout the plot.\\nThe novel continues from this point mainly as a Socratic dialogue between Ishmael and his new student as they hash out what Ishmael refers to as \"how things came to be this way\" for mankind.\\nIshmael\\'s life, which began in the African wilderness, was spent mostly in a zoo and a menagerie, and since had been spent in the gazebo of a man that extricated him from physical captivity.\\nHe tells his student that it was at the menagerie that he learned about human language and culture and began to think about things that he never would have pondered in the wild.\\nSubsequently, Ishmael tells his student that the subject for this learning experience will be captivity, primarily the captivity of man under a distorted civilizational system.\\nThe narrator claims to Ishmael that he has a vague notion of living in some sort of cultural captivity and being lied to in some way but he can not explain his feelings.\\nBefore proceeding Ishmael lays some ground definitions for his student.\\nHe defines: Ishmael proceeds to tease from his pupil the premises of the story (ie.\\nmyth) being enacted by the Takers: that they are the pinnacle of evolution, that the world was made for man, and that man is here to conquer and rule the world.\\nThis rule is meant to bring about a paradise, as man increases his mastery of the world, however, he is always failing because he is flawed.\\nMan doesn\\'t know how to live and never will because that knowledge is unobtainable.\\nSo, however hard he labors to save the world, he is just going to go on defiling and spoiling it.\\nIshmael points out to his student that when the Takers decided there is something fundamentally wrong with humans, they took as evidence only their own culture\\'s history- \"They were looking at a half of one-percent of the evidence taken from a single culture-- Not a reasonable sample on which to base such a sweeping conclusion\".\\nIshmael says:  There\\'s nothing fundamentally wrong with people.\\nGiven a story to enact that puts them in accord with the world, they will live in accord with the world.\\nBut given a story to enact that puts them at odds with the world, as yours does, they will live at odds with the world.\\nGiven a story to enact in which they are the lords of the world, they will act as the lords of the world.\\nAnd, given a story to enact in which the world is a foe to be conquered, they will conquer it like a foe, and one day, inevitably, their foe will lie bleeding to death at their feet, as the world is now.\\nIshmael goes on to help his student discover that, contrary to what the Takers think, there are immutable laws that life is subject to and it is possible to discern them by studying the biological community.\\nTogether, Ishmael and his student identify one set of survival strategies which appear to be evolutionarily stable for all species (later dubbed the \"Law of Limited Competition\"): In short, \"you may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down competitors or destroy their food or deny them access to food.\\nIn other words, you may compete but you may not wage war\".\\nAll species inevitably follow this law, or as a consequence go extinct.\\nThe Takers believe themselves to be exempt from this Law and flout it at every point.\\nHe explains how the Takers rendered themselves above the laws governing life, using the story of The Fall of Man as an example.\\nIshmael\\'s version of why the fruit was forbidden to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is: eating the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil provides the gods with the knowledge of who shall live and who shall dieâ\\x80\\x94knowledge which they need to rule the world.\\nThe fruit nourishes only the gods, though.\\nIf Adam (\"man\") were to eat from this tree, he might think that he gained the gods\\' wisdom (without this actually happening) and consequently destroy the world and himself through his arrogance.\\n\"And so they said to him, you may eat of every tree in the garden, save the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, for on the day you eat of that tree, you will certainly die\".\\nIshmael makes the point that this story of the Fall of Man, which the Takers have adopted as their own, was in fact developed by Leavers to explain the origin of the Takers.\\nIf it were of Taker origin, the story would be of liberating ascent instead of a sinful fall.\\nIshmael and his student go on to discuss how, for the ancient herders among whom the tale originated, the story of Cain killing Abel symbolizes the Leaver being killed off and their lands taken so that it could be put under cultivation.\\nThese ancient herders realized that the Takers were acting as if they were gods themselves, with all the wisdom of what is good and evil and how to rule the world.\\nAnd as a result the gods banished these people from the Garden and they were brought from a life of bounty in the hands of the gods to one of being the accursed tillers of the soil.\\nTo begin discerning the Leavers\\' story, Ishmael proposes to his student a hypothesis: the Takers\\' Agricultural Revolution was a revolution against the Leavers\\' story.\\nThe Leavers take what they need from the world and leave the rest alone.\\nLiving in this manner (\"in the hands of the gods\"), Leavers thrive in times of abundance and dwindle in times of scarcity.\\nThe Takers however, practicing their uniquely envisioned form of agriculture (dubbed by Quinn \"totalitarian agriculture\" in a later book) produce enormous food surpluses, which allows them to thwart the gods when they decide it\\'s the Takers\\' time to go hungry.\\n\"When you have more food than you need, then the gods have no power over you\".\\nThus, Ishmael points out that the Takers revolution was not just a technological change, but also serves a mythological function.\\nSo we have a new pair of names for you: The Takers are \\'those who know good and evil\\' and the Leavers are \\'those who live in the hands of the gods\\'.\\nIshmael goes on to point out that by living in the hands of the gods, man is subject to the conditions under which evolution takes place.\\nAustralopithecus became Homo by living in the hands of the godsâ\\x80\\x94Man became man by living in the hands of the gods-- \"by living the way the bushmen of Africa live; by living the way the Krenakarore of Brazil live.\\nNot the way the Chicagoans live, not the way Londoners live\".\\n\"In the hands of the gods is where evolution happens\".\\nAccording to the Takers\\' story, creation came to an end with man.\\n\"In order to make their story come true, the Takers have to put an end to creation itself-- and they\\'re doing a damn good job of it.\\n\" Ishmael brings together his synopsis on human culture by examining the story enacted by Leaver cultures, which provides a model of how to liveâ\\x80\\x94an alternative story for the Takers to enact.\\nThe premise of the Takers\\' story is \\'The world belongs to man.\\n\\'.\\nThe premise of the Leavers\\' story is \\'Man belongs to the world.\\n\\' For three million years, man belonged to the world and because he belonged to the world, he grew and developed and became brighter and more dexterous until one day, he was so bright and so dexterous that we had to call him Homo sapiens sapiens-- which means he was us.\\nThe Leavers\\' story is \\'the gods made man for the world, the same way they made salmon and sparrows for the world.\\nThis seems to have worked well so far so we can take it easy and leave the running of the world to the gods\\'.\\nIshmael emphasizes that \"not in any sense is the Takers story \\'chapter two\\' of the story which was being enacted here during the first three million years of human life.\\nThe Leavers\\' story has its own \\'chapter two\\'\".\\nIn evolution, observes Ishmael\\'s student, there seems to be a tendency toward complexity, and towards self-awareness and intelligence.\\nPerhaps the gods intend the world to be filled with intelligent, self-aware creatures and man\\'s destiny following the Leavers\\' story is \"to be the first- without being the last\"; to learn and then to be a role-model and teacher for all those capable of becoming what he\\'s become.\\nIshmael finishes with a summary of what his student can do if he earnestly desires to save the world: The story of

a real asteroid was named after the fictional asteroid).\\nThe asteroid\\'s most prominent features are three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) as well as a variety of plants.\\nThe prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet\\'s soil; in particular, pulling out baobab trees that are constantly trying to grow and overrun the surface.\\n\"Catastrophe,\" the little prince would call it.\\nThe prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants until the narrator informs him that a sheep will even eat roses with thorns.\\nUpon hearing this, the prince tells of his love for a mysterious rose that began growing on the asteroid\\'s surface some time ago.\\nThe prince says he nourished the rose and listened to her when she told him to make a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind.\\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him, and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe.\\nAlthough the rose finally apologized for her vanity, and the two reconciled, she encouraged him to go ahead with his journey and so he traveled onward.\\nThe prince misses his rose and claims that he only needs to look at the millions of stars to be reminded of his rose, since his rose is among one of them.\\nThe prince has since visited six other asteroids, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society.\\nThey include: a king with no subjects; a vain man who believes himself the most admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet; a drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of being a drunkard; a businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing materialism); a lamplighter who wastes his life blindly following orders and extinguishing and relighting a lamp once a minute; and an elderly geographer.\\nLike the others, the geographer is closed-minded, providing a caricature of specialization in the contemporary world.\\nThe prince tells him: \"Your planet is very beautiful.\\nHas it any oceans.\\n\"\"I couldn\\'t tell you,\" said the geographer.\\n\"But you are a geographer.\\n\"\"Exactly,\" the geographer said.\\n\"But I am not an explorer.\\nI haven\\'t a single explorer on my planet.\\nIt is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts.\\nThe geographer is much too important to go loafing about.\\nHe does not leave his desk\"Similarly, when the geographer asked the prince to describe his home, the prince mentioned the rose, and the geographer explained that he does not record \"ephemeral\" things, such as roses, suggesting again the tendency of adults in general and specialists in particular to overlook the most important aspects of life.\\nThis reinforces the prince\\'s convictions that grown-ups are a sad, dull, unimaginative, lot.\\nThe geographer recommended that the prince next visit the planet Earth.\\nSince the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited.\\nHe then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return.\\nThe prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives.\\nAfter climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape.\\nWhen the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the mocking voices of others.\\nEventually, the prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique.\\nHe began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common.\\nHe lay down on the grass and wept, until a fox came along.\\nThe fox desired to be tamed and explained to the prince that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince\\'s love.\\nThe fox also explained that, in a way, the prince had tamed the rose, and that this is why the prince was now feeling so responsible for her.\\nThe prince then took the time to tame the fox, though the two were sad to have to part ways.\\nThe prince next came across a railway switchman, who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows.\\nA merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week.\\nThe prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator\\'s plane crash and the narrator is dying of thirst; miraculously, he and the prince find a well.\\nThe narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and eagerness to see his rose again, who he worries has been left to fend for herself.\\nThe prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet.\\nThe prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will make him upset.\\nThe narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince\\'s side; the prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need to look at the stars to think of the prince\\'s lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing.\\nThe prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, falling without making a sound.\\nThe next morning, the narrator tries to look for the prince, but is unable to find his body.\\nHe finally manages to repair his airplane and leave the desert.\\nThe story ends with the narrator\\'s drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince\\'s life.\\nThe narrator requests that anyone in that area encountering a small young man who refuses to answer questions should contact the narrator immediately.\\n',\n",

Echtelion high above the Pelennor Fields.\\nThey meet Denethor, the Lord and Steward of Gondor, and deliver the news to him of Boromir\\'s death; but Denethor already knows of his son\\'s death because he holds Boromir\\'s cloven horn in his lap, as well as the fact that a devastating attack on his city by Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor is imminent.\\nStung by the scorn of Denethor, Pippin enters the service of the Steward as repayment of a debt he owes to Boromir, Denethor\\'s dead son and preferred heir.\\nPippin then meets Beregond a guard of the Citadel, who tutors him in his duties, and his young son Bergil, who guides him around Minas Tirith.\\nIn the middle of night, Gandalf returns to their room, frustrated that Faramir has not yet returned.\\nMeanwhile, in Rohan, King ThÃ©oden and his Rohirrim are recovering from the Battle of the Hornburg, in which they defended Rohan against the forces of Saruman at great cost.\\nOn their way back from Isengard, Aragorn, the king, and his company are met by the Company of Rangers from Arnor in the north (the \"Grey Company\"), led by Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond, and Halbarad, a leader of Rangers from the North.\\nThey had answered the summons of Galadriel to join Aragorn in his cause.\\nWhen they return to Hornburg, Aragorn informs the king that he shall not ride with the Rohirrim, having confronted Sauron through the palantÃ\\xadr (seeing-stone) of Isengard.\\nInstead, able to see a new threat to Gondor, he decides to go travel the Paths of the Dead and find the lost army of the undead oathbreakers who dwell under the Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain.\\nThese spirits were cursed because they did not help Isildur during the War of the Last Alliance.\\nHelped by his companions Legolas and Gimli as well as the Grey Company, they ride to Dunharrow.\\nWhen they arrive, Ã\\x89owyn, tries to dissuade Aragorn from going and then--desperate to stay with him--tries to go as well.\\nAragorn cannot release Eowyn from her duties and cannot return the love she has for him and reluctantly sets out the next morning to recruit the Army of the Dead to his cause.\\nThe company then passes under the Haunted Mountain where they come across the bones of a missing prince of Rohan, who had foolishly ventured on the Paths of the Dead.\\nThey company then comes out on the other side of the mountain into the valley of the Morthond River in Gondor and then proceed to the Stone of Erech.\\nThere, the Oathbreakers gather around the Grey Company in the middle of the night and resolve to fulfill their oath.\\nThey all then ride east to the great port of Pelargir and vanish into the storm of Mordor.\\nAfter Aragorn departs on his seemingly impossible task, King ThÃ©oden, Eomer, and Merry arrive in Dunharrow to muster the Rohirrim (mounted cavalry) and come to the aid of Gondor.\\nThey enter the upper hold of Dunharrow via a narrow switchback path where they see old \"Pukel-Men\" guarding the turns.\\nMerry is so moved by the kindness of ThÃ©oden that he enters his service and is made a Knight of the Mark.\\nSeeing Ã\\x89owyn grieved by Aragorn\\'s departure, Merry then asks about the Paths of Dead and is told the story by ThÃ©oden of how King Brego and his son Baldor discovered the entrance to the chambers under the Haunted Mountain and how Baldor rashly spoke an oath to travel the Paths of the Dead.\\nThe next morning was dominated by the darkness of Mordor and two riders from Gondor showing ThÃ©oden the Red Arrow, which was Gondor\\'s official call for aid from Rohan.\\nThe King and Eomer then gather the riders and set out from Dunharrow and then Edoras.\\nEager to go to war with his allies, Merry is refused by ThÃ©oden several times.\\nFinally Dernhelm, one of the Rohirrim, secretly takes Merry up on his horse so that he can accompany the rest of the Rohirrim.\\nBack in Minas Tirith, Pippin is now clad in the uniform of the tower guard and watches the fortunes of war unfold.\\nFaramir, Boromir\\'s younger brother, returns from his campaign with the shattered remnants of his company from Ithilien where he reveals that he has met Frodo and Sam and allowed them to continue on their mission.\\nWhen Gandalf hears that they are heading for Cirith Ungol, he becomes afraid, and Denethor becomes angry at Faramir for what he thinks was a foolish decision.\\nThe next day, Denethor orders Faramir to ride out and continue the hopeless defence of Osgiliath against a horde of orcs.\\nOsgiliath is soon overrun and a gravely wounded Faramir is carried back to Denethor.\\nDenethor then descends into madness as the hosts of Mordor press ever closer to Gondor\\'s capital city of Minas Tirith, burning the Pelennor Fields and then the first circle of the city.\\nHis people seemingly lost and his only remaining son all but dead, Denethor orders a funeral pyre built that is to claim both him and his dying son.\\nA fearful Pippin witnesses all this and runs down to the first circle to find Gandalf.\\nThere, the hosts of Mordor, led by the dreaded Witch-king of Angmar, have succeeded in breaking through the gates of Minas Tirith--using a terrifying battering ram named Grond, and only Gandalf is left sitting on his horse Shadowfax to oppose him.\\nJust as the Witch-King raises his sword to strike the wizard, the horns of Rohan can be heard coming to the aid of Gondor.\\nAided by a tribe of Wild Men of the Woods who resemble the Pukel-Men of Dunharrow, ThÃ©oden\\'s forces travel through the long-forgotten path to avoid an Orc ambush on the main road and reach Minas Tirith by stealth.\\nAt first it seems that they are too late, but then the winds change and begin to dispel the darkness.\\nRevived, the Rohirrim charge into the enemy on the Pelennor.\\nThÃ©oden is mortally wounded when the Nazgul cause his horse to go mad and fall on him and placing him at the mercy of the Witch-King.\\nIn the following Battle of the Pelennor Fields the Witch-king is slain by Dernhelm, revealed to be Ã\\x89owyn the niece of King ThÃ©oden, with help from Merry.\\nThe battle is also joined by a \"black fleet with black sails\".\\nThe forces of Mordor initially rejoice at its arrival; and then are horrified to see the banner of the King upon the ships.\\nAragorn has succeeded in using the Oathbreakers to defeat the Corsairs of Umbar; the men of Gondor who were once slaves on the ships are brought back to fight the host of Mordor.\\nThus the siege is broken, but at heavy cost: many warriors of Gondor and Rohan fall, among them King ThÃ©oden.\\nWhile the battle is raging, Denethor attempts to immolate himself and Faramir on his funeral pyre, but Gandalf and Pippin succeed in saving Faramir, aided by Beregond, who has deserted his post and killed several of Denethor\\'s servants in order to save Faramir.\\nWhen Gandalf advises Denethor to put aside his madness and go out into battle, Denethor reveals that he has used the palantÃ\\xadr of Minas Tirith and declares the situation hopeless.\\nDenethor also reveals that he knows of Aragorn and his claim to the kingship but will not accept him.\\nHe then burns himself with the palantÃ\\xadr on the pyre.\\nGandalf realizes that Denethorâ\\x80\\x94in his desperationâ\\x80\\x94had looked into the seeing-stone several times.\\nUnlike Saruman, Denethor was too noble of purpose and too great of will to submit to the will of Sauron, but the Dark Lord duped the Steward into despairing of the situation.\\nThe resulting madness kept Gandalf from joining the battle and perhaps saving ThÃ©oden and keeping Ã\\x89owyn and Merry from harm.\\nFaramir, though, is brought to the Houses of Healing where Gandalf awaits the wounded and Pippin and Beregond guard Faramir, the new Steward of Gondor.\\nIn the Houses of Healing, Aragorn heals Faramir, using athelas or kingsfoil (the same weed he used to ease Frodo\\'s pain at Weathertop and outside of Moria).\\nAragorn also heals Merry and Ã\\x89owyn, who were hurt by the Witch-king before he fell, and he then turns his attention to the numerous wounded, showing the true skill of a king is that of a healer and earning him the love and admiration of the people of Minas Tirith.\\nLegolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin and tell of their great journey on the Paths of the Dead and how Aragorn could even command the spirits of the Dead.\\nThey then tell the story of the capture of the Black Fleet and the rescue of Minas Tirith.\\nThe kings and warriors then hold a final council with Gandalf, who has been chosen as the leader of the forces opposed to Sauron.\\nKnowing that it is only a matter of time before Sauron rebuilds his forces for another attack, Gandalf and Aragorn decide to draw out the hosts of Mordor with an assault on the Black Gate, providing a distraction so that Frodo and Sam may have a chance of reaching Mount Doom and destroy the One Ring, unseen by the Eye of Sauron.\\nThey realize that it may be a suicide mission, but they also know it is the only hope for the Ringbearer.\\nGandalf, Aragorn and the other Captains of the West lead an army to the Black Gate of Mordor and lay siege to Sauron\\'s army.\\nThe Mouth of Sauron, a messenger from the Black Gate, displays Frodo\\'s mithril shirt, his elven-cloak and Sam\\'s barrow-blade and then demands the surrender of the Captains and their obeisance to Sauron as conditions for Frodo\\'s release.\\nDespite the shock of seeing the objects and the complete loss of hope, Gandalf perceives that the emissary is lying, seizes the items, and rejects the terms.\\nThe battle begins and Pippin kills a Troll, which then falls onto him, and he loses consciousness just as the Great Eagles arrive.\\nBearing the One Ring in Frodo\\'s place, Sam resolves to rescue his master from torture and death by Orcs in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.\\nHe enters the tower through the front gate and overcomes the silent sentinels using the Phial of Galadriel.\\nHe discovers that the orcs have mostly killed each other over Frodo\\'s mithril coat and then confronts the orc-captain Shagrat, who has just finished off his rival Gorbag.\\nShagrat escapes with the mithril coat, the eleven cloak, and the Barrow-sword.\\nSam goes up to the top chamber of the tower, kills a small orc hurting Frodo, and then discovers his master lying naked on the floor.\\nSam reveals that he has saved the Ring, and Frodo becomes nearly insane demanding it back from him.\\nThey are forced to disguise themselves in Orcish armour and manage to escape the tower and the Watchers just as the Nazgul flies in to take over command of the tower.\\nFrodo and Sam navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor.\\nUnable to cross directly to Mount Doom, they travel north, are nearly discovered by two orcs and tracking them, and realize that Gollum is still on their trail.\\nJust as they are about to reach the pass into the Morannon, they are overtaken by a company of Orcs.\\nThey escape, but the burden of the Ring and the torrid conditions begin to break Frodo\\'s will.\\nGandalf\\'s plan to distract Sauron from the Ring is successful: Mordor is almost empty as all the remaining Orcs have been summoned to defend the land against the assault of the army led by Gandalf and Aragorn.\\nAfter a weary and dangerous journey on the road to the Dark Tower itself, Frodo and Sam finally reach their final destination of Mount Doom.\\nAs they climb up the Mountain, Gollum attacks them once more; but Frodo is easily able to throw off the starving and emaciated creature.\\nSam spares Gollum\\'s life in one last show of pity and kicks him down the Mountain.\\nAs Frodo is preparing to throw the Ring into the Crack of Doom, he succumbs to the Ring\\'s power and claims it as his own.\\nJust then, Gollum, who had been following Frodo and Sam still, attacks Frodo and bites off his finger and the Ring.\\nGollum gloats over getting his precious back, but he ends up losing his balance and falls to death and takes the Ring with him.\\nThe Ring is finally destroyed, freeing Middle-earth from Sauron\\'s power.\\nMount Doom erupts violently, trapping Frodo and Sam among the lava flows until the Great Eagles rescue them.\\nUpon Sauron\\'s defeat, his armies at the Gate flee.\\nSauron finally appears as a gigantic shadow trying to reach out for the armies of men, but is now powerless and is blown away by a wind.\\nThe men under Sauron\\'s command that surrender are forgiven and allowed to return to their lands in peace.\\nFrodo and Sam are saved from the lava, meet again with the other surviving members of the Fellowship, and then honoured on the Field of Cormallen in Ithilien.\\nIn Minas Tirith, Faramir and Ã\\x89owyn meet in the Houses of Healing and fall in love with each other, with Ã\\x89owyn choosing to eschew any further hopes of glory with Argorn.\\nAragorn comes to Minas Tirith and is crowned King of Gondor outside the walls of the city in a celebration during which Frodo brings Aragorn the ancient crown of Gondor, and Gandalf places the crown on Aragorn.\\nA healed Faramir is appointed Prince of Ithilien, and Beregondâ\\x80\\x94who saved Faramir\\'s life from the madness of Denethorâ\\x80\\x94is named captain of Faramir\\'s guard.\\nGandalf and Aragorn go off high above the city and find a seedling of the White Tree, which Aragorn then plants in Minas Tirith in place of the dead tree.\\nSoon after, Arwen, daughter of Elrond of Rivendell, as well as Celeborn and Galadriel come to Minas Tirith, and Aragorn marries Arwen.\\nA series of goodbyes then takes place, with many riding to Rohan for the burial of ThÃ©oden and the wedding of Faramir and Ã\\x89owyn.\\nThey then return to Isengard and find that Treebeard has removed the stone circle, planted trees, and created a lake out of which Orthanc still stands.\\nHe informs Gandalf that he let Saruman and GrÃ\\xadma go out of pity, but Gandalf says that Saruman might still be capable of doing some harm.\\nAragorn says farewell at Isengard.\\nThey then overtake Saruman and find that he has completely devolved into meanness and Wormtongue barely able to act human.\\nElrond, Gandalf, and the hobbits return to Rivendell and find that Bilbo has aged tremendously now that the Ring has been destroyed.\\nElrond advises Frodo that he should be ready to meet them on one last journey soon.\\nThey then leave Rivendell and arrive at Bree and find that the little town is in a great state of fear.\\nThe innkeeper Butterbur informs the travellers that evil men had come up the Greenway and started trouble, even killing some of the inhabitants, while others like Bill Ferny had joined in with the vagabonds.\\nButterbur is put at ease and finally understands when they tell him that things will soon improve because Strider is the new king and will come north to stabilize the region.\\nThey leave Bree and come to the borders of the Shire where Gandalf leaves them to go and visit Bombadil.\\nThe Hobbits finally return home to the Shire, only to find that the Shire was in ruins, its inhabitants oppressed by Lotho Sackville-Baggins (usually called \"The Chief\" or \"The Boss\") who is in reality controlled by a shadowy figure called \"Sharkey\".\\nSharkey has taken complete control of the Shire using corrupt Men and half-orcs, and had begun felling trees in a gratuitous programme of industrialization (which actually produces nothing except destruction and misery for the locals).\\nThe worst area was around the villages of Bywater and Hobbiton, leading the hobbits to realize that Mordor had come home to them.\\nMerry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam make plans to set things right once more.\\nWith the help of the Cotton family, they lead an uprising of Hobbits and are victorious at the Battle of Bywater which effectively frees the Shire.\\nAt the very doorstep of Bag End, they meet Sharkey, who is revealed to be the fallen wizard Saruman, and his much-abused servant GrÃ\\xadma.\\nAfter Saruman reveals that GrÃ\\xadma has murdered (and probably cannibalized) Lotho, GrÃ\\xadma then jumps on his back and cuts his throat.\\nGrÃ\\xadma is himself slain by hobbit archers as he attempts to escape.\\nSaruman\\'s soul is blown away into the east, and his body decays instantly into a skeleton.\\nOver time, the Shire is healed.\\nThe many trees that Saruman\\'s men cut down are replanted with Galadriel\\'s gift of dust used to facilitate growth and a small nut that is planted to replace the party tree; buildings are rebuilt and peace is restored.\\nSam marries Rosie Cotton, with whom he had been entranced for some time.\\nMerry and Pippin become the Master of Buckland and the Thain of Tuckborough respectively and become renowned as heroes throughout the Shire along with Sam, who will eventually become the Mayor.\\nFrodo, however, recedes from the picture and also cannot escape the pain of his wounds, having been stabbed by the Witch-king and poisoned by Shelob in addition to losing a finger.\\nFurthermore, his long burden of carrying the Ring has left him with post-traumatic stress.\\nFrodo departs for the Undying Lands in the West with Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and many Elves, including Elrond, and Galadriel.\\nGandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel all carry with them the Three Eleven Rings out of Middle-Earth.\\nWith their departure, the Third Age ended.\\nSam, Merry, and Pippin watch Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo, and the Elves depart and return home.\\nNow heir to all of Frodo\\'s possessions, Sam returns to Bag End, saddened by Frodo\\'s departure.\\nWhen Sam returns home at the end of the book, though, he is greeted by Rosie and his daughter, Elanor.\\n',\n",

harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light.\\nThey did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature.\\nThis power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals.\\nDisturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals.\\nThese so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world.\\nBut their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained.\\nOn that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.\\nFinal Fantasy III focuses around four orphans from the remote village of Ur, each starting off as an Onion Knight in the original game, but as Freelancers in the Nintendo DS remake, which also individualized the party members, giving them unique appearances (designed by Akihiko Yoshida), backstories, personalities and names: An earthquake opens up a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave near the village of Ur on the floating continent.\\nFour young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village

dark crystals to free the imprisoned Dark Warriors and defeat the Cloud of Darkness, thereby restoring the crystals and balance to the world.\\nIn the DS remake, there are also several \"side quests\" that can also be completed.\\nThe story is virtually the same in the DS version, but with some major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake.\\nHe is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal.\\nIt tells him that he has

enough to see them off, they go back to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home.\\nThe three boys consult with Cid, and then Takka, who builds a mythril ram on the ship.\\nIt should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid\\'s airship, the player would be able to piece together why: she had told Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the

wife of the Head of the School of English, Marianne Richmond, kissing passionately in the kitchen.\\n(At that point of time she does not know that there is not more to it than meets the eye, that they are just playing some sort of secret game) One weekend quite early during her stay, after they have been in the hot water outside and with Carrie already in the house, Messenger plants a firm kiss on Helen\\'s lips.\\nFrom the secret journal he is keeping, we know that Messenger fancies her.\\nHelen does not actually resist the kiss, but afterwards she tells him unmistakably that she is not going to have an affair with him because, among other things, she strongly disapproves of adultery.\\nFrom Helen\\'s own journal, however, we learn that she is sexually aroused by his presence and by just thinking of him.\\nMessenger, who does not know anything about Helen\\'s real feelings, thinks that he has made his pass at her prematurely and, by doing so, has spoiled any future liaison with her.\\nMeanwhile, Helen tries to focus on her work.\\nThe students she has to teach are a small, friendly and ambitious group who meet on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.\\nHer class is to a large extent about their work in progress, mainly novels which they started during the preceding term.\\nWhen Sandra Pickering, one of the students, belatedly submits some chapters from the novel she is writing, Helen immediately recognises one of the male characters as having been modelled on her late husband Martin.\\nAs Helen herself has based a character in her novel The Eye of the Storm on Martin, she is about to accuse Sandra Pickering of plagiarism when, to her dismay, she finds out that the girl used to work for the BBC some years ago, that she knew Martin, and that she actually had an affair with him.\\n(Sandra knows, and writes about, intimate details such as what he preferred doing immediately after sex) Gradually it dawns upon Helen that her husband must have had a whole succession of young lovers, with everyone except herself knowing everything, or at least suspecting a lot, about it, while she herself, only mildly promiscuous during her student days, was never unfaithful to him.\\nAt this point Helen decides to never again shed a tear for him and get on with her own life instead.\\nIn this new light, not even Messenger\\'s advances seem so monstrous any more.\\nShe makes another discovery which almost turns her view of the world upside down.\\nOn a free afternoon, she escapes the stifling atmosphere of the campus to explore the surrounding countryside.\\nSeated over lunch in a pub in the small town of Ledbury.\\nAn embarrassing encounter at the pub follows, with all three of them keeping up appearances and being polite and reserved.\\nLater, however, during a duck race (a fund-raising event with plastic ducks \"racing\" down a small river), Carrie confides in Helen: She knows all (or almost everything) about her husband\\'s flings and, by taking a lover herself, tries to get back at him.\\nRalph Messenger, she is quite sure, does not know anything about her affair.\\nAlso, Carrie tells her that she screwed around a lot while she was studying at UC Berkeley, but only with faculty, never with other students.\\nBack home in the USA, Mr Thurlow, Carrie\\'s rich father, has two serious heart attacks in a row so that Carrie books the first flight home.\\nShe takes Hope with her.\\nWith Carrie out of the way for some time â\\x80\\x93 in the end it turns out to be three weeks â\\x80\\x93 Helen, who has recently let herself be seduced by Messenger, spends the most beautiful and romantic â\\x80\\x93 or rather lustful â\\x80\\x93 three weeks since her husband\\'s death.\\nIn the language of the kind of novels she loves reading, she describes herself as having become \"a woman of pleasure, a scarlet woman, a woman of easy virtue\".\\nShe and Messenger have sex practically every day, and at all kinds of places.\\nHelen, who prefers a bedroom with the curtains drawn, is amazed at, and eventually fascinated by, Messenger\\'s lust and ingenuity when it comes to selecting odd spots for making love, for instance a prehistoric burial mound on top of a hill, with some hikers approaching.\\nHelen also volunteers to perform the duties of a housewife for Carrie and then stays over at the Messengers\\' house.\\nAt night, she and Ralph Messenger derive some additional pleasure from trying not to make any sound during their lovemaking so as not to arouse the kids\\' suspicion.\\n(But Emily, who has an 18-year-old boyfriend and who discusses her sex life with her mother, seems to know what is going on anyway and at one point almost blackmails her stepfather) Soon Helen ponders the question whether she is actually falling in love with him and, consequently, if and how their affair will continue after the end of the term.\\nOnly once, when they are in bed together, can he not get an erection.\\nA final breach of confidence committed by Ralph Messenger makes it much easier for Helen to leave him and go back to London.\\nAlso, for the first time, it inadvertently triggers some emotion in Messenger, albeit a negative one: jealousy.\\nWhen he is waiting for Helen in her maisonette, he cannot resist the temptation to turn on her laptop and read parts of her journal.\\nThis is how he learns about his own wife\\'s infidelity.\\nWhen Helen enters her apartment, his jealousy gets the better of him so that he cannot hide the fact that he has invaded her privacy.\\n(Originally, he suggested that they should exchange their respective journals, as each of them would profit from reading the other\\'s, but Helen categorically refused)  Ralph Messenger does have to be operated on after all, but the surgery is successful.\\nHowever, he somewhat ages and, in the process, loses his reputation as a woman-chaser.\\nIn 1999, he publishes a new book entitled Machine Living and in due course is awarded a CBE.\\nHe never confronts Carrie with her affair and remains married to her.\\nHelen Reed returns to London and resumes writing.\\nSome time later she meets a new partner, but she does not move in with him (or he with her).\\nIn the following year she publishes Crying is a Puzzler, a novel about life on campus quite similar to that of the University of Gloucester.\\n',\n",

Gregorio, a Spaniard on his fishing detail; Unhygienix, the Italian head chef obsessed with soap since he handles fish every day; Jesse and Cassie, two lovers; Ella, who works second-in-command to Unhygienix; and finally, Jed â\\x80\\x94 the loner of the group whose mysterious job involves going alone into the jungle.\\nRichard later discovers that Jed has been assigned by Sal to be the island\\'s guardian: he watches the sea and shores of the neighboring islands for any signs of people attempting to discover the beach.\\nJed also has a sideline of stealing some cannabis from the Thai farmers\\' side of the island.\\nOne day, Unhygienix informs everyone that their rice supply has been infected by a fungus and Sal announces an emergency Rice Run â\\x80\\x94 an occasional discreet trip to the mainland by boat to bulk-buy rice and other essentials.\\nDue to the laborious nature of the task, no one volunteers for it except Jed, who, to the bewilderment of most others, always takes the job.\\nRichard also volunteers, and so the two travel back to Koh Phangan for their supplies.\\nIt is during the Rice Run that Jed finds out that Richard gave a copy of the map to Sammy and Zeph when Jed coincidentally wanders past and overhears the two Americans relaying the urban legend of the beach to some Germans.\\nThe Rice Run goes without a hitch but soon, accompanied by three Germans they met on the mainland, Zeph and Sammy make their way to the nearest neighbouring island, which worries Richard because he will be blamed if they successfully reach the community.\\nSoon after, Sal reassigns Richard to the perimeter detail to partner with Jed and keep a close eye on the potential invaders.\\nWith a free spot in Gregorio\\'s fishing detail, Keaty moves in to take Richard\\'s place.\\nA few days later, Keaty mistakenly catches a dead squid that gives severe food poisoning to most of the group, with the few remaining healthy members struggling to nurse the sick residents back to health.\\nRichard returns from his sentry duty to find that Bugs has punched Keaty in the face for his mistake.\\nRichard, having never liked Bugs due to his arrogant nature, instigates a heated argument with him in front of the whole group, which leads to a division of the community into several cliques.\\nOn this day, only two of the fishing details are still in operation and the best detail, consisting of three Swedes â\\x80\\x94 Christo, Sten and Karl â\\x80\\x94 who fish outside the safe lagoon area, are attacked by a shark.\\nThe camp only finds out about this with the return of one of the three, Karl, in the early evening.\\nKarl carries Sten on his back to the village, where Sten is discovered to have already bled to death.\\nKarl was not physically hurt by the shark, but he suffers severe emotional trauma from having watched his friend die.\\nHe subsequently spends his time sitting in a dug-out hole on the beach and not talking to anyone; barely accepting food and water.\\nRichard realizes that Christo is still missing and, at his own risk, retrieves him from partially submerged caves of the lagoon.\\nRichard is praised for his heroic rescue of Christo.\\nHowever, as Christo is gravely wounded, he requires Jed\\'s presence in the camp, because only Jed has the medical knowledge to tend to him.\\nThis leaves Richard to work the sentry detail alone.\\nA few days later, a funeral is held for Sten near the jungle waterfall, and Sal gives a decisive speech which goes some way to restoring social harmony.\\nShe announces that it is 11 September, and that they will thus be celebrating the Tet festival in three days\\' time.\\nSpending long hours alone in the forest as he hikes between lookout spots, Richard begins to experience hallucinations in which Daffy appears: they converse and patrol the part of the island which Richard refers to as the DMZ together.\\nRichard comes to appreciate that Daffy killed himself because he could neither endure the unravelling of his elitist vision of the beach as the group grew in size, nor bear the thought of a return to backpacking or settled life, and notes that he himself is falling prey to that way of thinking.\\nRichard also realizes that Daffy gave him the map â\\x80\\x94 as well as spreading rumors of the island all over Thailand â\\x80\\x94 so many travelers would come looking for the beach, inevitably leading to it becoming a tourist destination.\\nDaffy describes this act as \"euthanizing\" the community, and Richard realizes he was merely a pawn in Daffy\\'s revenge plan.\\nThis comes to a head following the arrival of the American/German group by raft.\\nUnlike Richard, Ã\\x89tienne, and FranÃ§oise who managed to overcome all obstacles in getting to the beach, the newcomers never make it past the most dangerous hurdle: the cannabis farmers.\\nRichard witnesses them being first beaten violently and then dragged away.\\nThe sound of gunshots implies the farmers have murdered the intruders.\\nRichard returns to the community campsite to immediately inform Sal and Jed of what happened.\\nHe then goes to the beach to visit Karl, who attacks Richard and runs off into the jungle.\\nOn the day of the Tet festival, Sal obtusely asks Richard to kill Karl because of the threat he poses to the group\\'s now-fragile social integrity, complaining that she constantly has to lift morale in the wake of the poisoning incident and Sten\\'s death.\\nRichard, disillusioned with the beach, resolves to escape with his closest friends.\\nThat night, he swims out to the cave where the group\\'s only boat is kept, only to find that Karl has used it to escape to the mainland.\\nÃ\\x89tienne corners him thereafter and soon discovers that he, along with the rest of his clique, has become frightened of Richard \"doing things\" for Sal.\\nRichard convinces Ã\\x89tienne, FranÃ§oise, Jed and a paranoid Keaty to leave the beach for good, and euthanizes the dying Christo.\\nNow fully aware of what Sal is willing to do to protect the beach, they decide to spike the food for the party and escape on the raft that the doomed backpackers used.\\nNight falls, and the party begins.\\nPrior to dinner, Keaty and Richard spike the stew Unhygienix cooked with fermented coconut milk and a huge amount of cannabis to immobilize the group.\\nRichard and his friends are about to slip away when the Thai farmers arrive.\\nThe farmers threaten all of them with guns as they believe that the beach dwellers invited the recent arrivals.\\nThe farmers beat up Richard, while leaving the bloodied corpses of the American/German backpackers as a warning.\\nAt the sight of this, the extremely intoxicated group experience a collective mental breakdown and start to rip the corpses apart in a frenzy.\\nSal discovers that Richard has spread the secret of the beach when she picks up the map he drew for Zeph and Sammy.\\nUpon hearing this, the now unstable community members attack Richard with sharp objects.\\nRichard believes he is about to die, but he is saved when FranÃ§oise, Ã\\x89tienne, Keaty and Jed return from the beach armed with their fishing spears to drive the others off, while seriously wounding Sal and Bugs in the process.\\nRichard and his rescuers make their planned escape on the raft.\\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that the five friends got away and split up when they reached the mainland.\\nIt has been a year and one month since his departure from Thailand, and Richard has returned home to Britain and hasn\\'t heard from FranÃ§oise and Ã\\x89tienne again, but states he is likely to bump into them eventually because \"the world is a small place, and Europe is even smaller\".\\nHe still keeps in contact with Keaty and Jed.\\nBy chance, Keaty and Jed end up working new jobs in the same building, although for different companies; similar to how they both happened to stay in the same guesthouse years before they first met at the beach.\\nHe also hears in a news report that Cassie has been arrested in Malaysia for smuggling a large amount of heroin and will be the first Westerner to be executed in the country in six years.\\nRichard wonders whether other people got off the island, particularly Unhygienix, whom he liked.\\nHe believes that Bugs died and hopes that Sal died too, because he does not like the idea of her \"turning up on his doorstep\".\\nRichard finishes by saying he is content with his life, though he carries a lot of scars: \"I like the way that sounds.\\nI carry a lot of scars\".\\n',\n",

in return, Kennedy pushes over their peanut wagon.\\nHarpo responds by stepping knee-deep into Kennedy\\'s lemonade tank, where he imitates a stereotypical Italian grape-crushing peasant; this drives off Kennedy\\'s waiting line of customers.\\nJust before the Mirror Scene is the Radio Scene.\\nHarpo tries the combination to the safe on a box which proves to be a radio, and it starts blaring the break-up strain of John Philip Sousa\\'s \"Stars and Stripes Forever\".\\nThe music continues despite frantic efforts to silence, and finally destroy, the radio.\\nHarpo often doffed his hat on-screen, but Chico very rarely removed his Tyrolean hat, even when indoors.\\nFor a few seconds on-screen in the earlier scene, Chico\\'s head is uncovered, revealing a wavy wig.\\nChico had already started going bald when the brothers appeared in their first Broadway production, I\\'ll Say She Is, in 1924.\\nAll of the Brothers\\' natural receding-hairline patterns were similar, but Harpo and Chico covered theirs with wigs (Groucho would later sport an obvious toupee in the films At The Circus and Go West).\\n',\n",

              " 758: 'Giambattista Basile, an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled Lo cunto de li cunti (The Story of Stories), or Pentamerone.\\nIt included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper.\\nIt was published posthumously in 1634.\\nPlot: One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon.\\nThe popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers.\\nPlot:  The first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.\\nWithout it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.\\nHowever, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at: That \"without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense.\\nThese, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them.\\nHowever, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother\".\\nAnother well-known version was recorded by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century.\\nThe tale is called \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Cinderella\" in English translations).\\nThis version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella\\'s father did not die and the step sisters cut off their own toes to fit in the golden slipper.\\nIn addition, there is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that she planted on her mother\\'s grave.\\nPlot:  Aschenputtel\\'s relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; Perrault\\'s version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter.\\nHowever, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child.\\nHe also describes Aschenputtel as his \"first wife\\'s child\" and not his own.\\nVillains: In some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella\\'s stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular Disney film, Cinderella\\'s father has died and Cinderella\\'s mother has died also.\\nAlthough many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor: in Fair, Brown and Trembling and Finette Cendron, the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen.\\nIn other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her.\\nOf this type (510B) are Cap O\\' Rushes, Catskin, All-Kinds-of-Fur, and Allerleirauh, and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.\\nIn Katie Woodencloak, the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.\\nIn La Cenerentola, Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her stepfather.\\n(This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters\\' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry.\\nFolklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.\\nBall, Ballgown, and Curfew: The number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three.\\nThe fairy godmother is Perrault\\'s own addition to the tale.\\nThe person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms\\'s version is her dead mother.\\nAschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing.\\nHelpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball.\\nThis motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as The Cinder Maid, collected by Joseph Jacobs, and the Finnish The Wonderful Birch.\\nPlaywright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical Into the Woods.\\nGiambattista Basile\\'s Cenerentola combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing.\\nOther variants have her helped by talking animals, as in Katie Woodencloak, Rushen Coatie, Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, The Story of Tam and Cam, or The Sharp Grey Sheepâ\\x80\\x94these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in The Golden Slipper, a fish aids her after she puts it in water.\\nIn \"The Anklet\", it\\'s a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball.\\nGioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola, in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince\\'s tutor.\\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired.\\nIn the Grimms\\' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father\\'s estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.\\nFurthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as Katie Woodencloak and The Golden Slipper have her attend church.\\nIn the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty.\\nHowever, on the third (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes.\\nIn her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince findsâ\\x80\\x94or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.\\nThe identifying item: The glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault\\'s version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the Brothers Grimm, German: Aschenbroedel and Aschenputtel, for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella\\'s identity.\\nIn Rossini\\'s opera \"La Cenerentola\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity.\\nIn the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers.\\nInterpreters unaware of the value attached to glass in 17th century France and perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault\\'s \"glass slipper\" (pantoufle de verre) had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (pantoufle de vair) in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault\\'s part.\\nThe 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.\\nAnother interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual elementâ\\x80\\x94the Prince was \\'trying on\\' the \\'fur slipper\\' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a \\'Droit du seigneur\\' right of sexual possession of his subjects.\\nThe disguised Cinderella\\'s \\'fur slipper\\' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).\\nThe translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella\\'s shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella\\'s feet being of a unique size for no particular reason.\\nHumorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone.\\nIn Terry Pratchett\\'s Witches Abroad, the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her.\\nIn \"When the Clock Strikes\" (from Red As Blood), Tanith Lee had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.\\nThe Revelation: Cinderella\\'s stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince\\'s hand for one of them.\\nIn the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother.\\nThe second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.\\nIn many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged.\\nOften, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters.\\nIn the Grimms\\' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.\\nThe prince nevertheless insists on her trying.\\nCinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).\\nThe Conclusion: In the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds.\\nIn other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.\\nIn The Thousand Nights and A Night, in a tale called \"The Anklet\", the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night.\\nIn The Wonderful Birch, the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth.\\nSuch tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\\nIn an episode of Jim Henson\\'s The Storyteller, writer Anthony Minghella merged the old folk tale Donkeyskin (also written by Perrault) with Cinderella to tell the tale of Sapsorrow, a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.\\nMany popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other.\\nExamples are the film Ever After, Cinderella 3 and the Broadway revival.\\nEver After (known in promotional material as Ever After: A Cinderella Story) is a 1998 American romantic comedy-drama film inspired by the fairy tale Cinderella, directed by Andy Tennant and starring Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott.\\nThe usual pantomime and comic/supernatural elements are removed and the story is instead treated as historical fiction, set in Renaissance-era France.\\nIt is often seen as a modern, post-feminism interpretation of the Cinderella myth.\\nThere is also Gregory Maguire\\'s novel Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, which gives the classic story from the view of one of the ugly stepsisters.\\nIn this version, the Cinderella character is unusually beautiful, but also a shy enigma.\\nHer stepsister, though plain, is charming and intelligent.\\nThe novel has themes much more adult than the traditional story.\\nLikewise there is a Marissa Meyer novel Cinder, which is set in a futuristic Beijing.\\nThe Cinderella character, named Cinder, is a cyborg mechanic, who meets Prince Kaito.\\nGail Carson Levine wrote Ella Enchanted, a story about how \"Ella\" is under a fairy curse of obedience (she does whatever someone tells her to).\\nA movie also has been made based on this book.\\nIn 1982, Roald Dahl rewrote the story in a more modern and gruesome way in his book Revolting Rhymes.\\nIn his book dr Gardner\\'s Fairy Tales for Today\\'s Children, dr Richard Gardener\\'s story \"Cinderelma\" has the heroine Cinderelma and the prince re-unite, then mutually decide to separate.\\nCinderelma then gets a job as a seamstress, later opens her own dress shop, and marries a young printer who owns the shop next door to hers.\\nIn 1995, Richard Conlon\\'s play Anastasia and Drizella was produced at Chicago\\'s Temporary Theatre.\\nIn it, Cinderella\\'s step sister Anastasia gets a master\\'s degree in finance, and her step sister Drizella gets a master\\'s degree in chemical engineering.\\nWhen the prince tries to have Cinderella\\'s step family beheaded, Anastasia buys the kingdom.\\nThe prince and Cinderella get married, and spend the rest of their lives working as servants for Cinderella\\'s step family, while the step sisters live happily ever after.\\nIn the 2005 picture book Ella\\'s Big Chance by Shirley Hughes, Ella is a dressmaker in her father\\'s shop, and when the stepsisters arrive they appoint themselves as models.\\nElla eventually chooses to marry Buttons, an employee in the shop, instead of the prince.\\nIn Emily Short\\'s 2006 interactive fiction short story Glass, it is Cinderella herself who has magical powers, and neither her stepmother nor her stepsisters are malicious.\\nThe royal ambitions of the stepmother plays a small part in their attempt to deceive the prince, but more importantly they are trying to protect Cinderella from the law of the land, under which practicing magic is punishable by death.\\nIn 2014, Bad Wolf Press published a musical version called Cinderella: A Modern Makeover, a fractured interpretation of the story featuring a more positive \"blended family\" home life as well as a heroine trying to get her dream job at the palace instead of a marriage proposal.\\nAlso in 2014, Rae Magdon published an unusual retelling of the story in a novel titled The Second Sister, in which

mysterious millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them.\\nNick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin, Daisy Fay Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, a college acquaintance of Nick\\'s.\\nThey introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, an attractive, cynical young golfer with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship.\\nShe reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the \"valley of ashes\", an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City.\\nNot long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment Tom keeps for his affairs with Myrtle and others.\\nAt Tom\\'s New York apartment, a vulgar and bizarre party takes place.\\nIt ends with Tom breaking Myrtle\\'s nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy\\'s name several times.\\nAs the summer progresses, Nick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby\\'s parties.\\nNick encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War.\\nThrough Jordan, Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917, when Daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services\\' work with young Officers headed to Europe.\\nFrom their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time, Gatsby became (and still is) deeply in love with Daisy.\\nAnd even more, he became obsessed with the idea of her, and the ideal of living in the world he saw her living in, as the fulfillment of all the possible dreams he could ever have.\\nGatsby spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of Tom and Daisy\\'s dock, across the bay from his mansion, hoping one day to rekindle their lost romance.\\nJordan confides in Nick that the only reason he bought the mansion is that it was across the bay from Tom and Daisy\\'s home.\\nAnd Gatsby\\'s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties were an attempt to impress Daisy and raise her curiosity about her \"anonymous\" neighbor across the bay.\\nGatsby had hoped that one day curiosity would have brought the unsuspecting Daisy to appear at his doorstep, and thereby he\\'d be able to present himself as a \"new man\", now of wealth and position, and now able to join her at her side and within her world.\\nThat however never played out, and although Tom had been invited (as a guest of Jordan\\'s) to a Gatsby party and had attended more than one of them, both he and Daisy had (for different reasons) never responded affirmatively to an RSVP to attend as the Buchanans (Mr.\\nand mrs).\\nThe deeper reasons behind this fact are expanded upon later in the story by Daisy.\\nHis research of Nick, who has so fortuitously rented the small cottage next door to Gatsby\\'s mansion, results in a wholly new approach to his problem of how to introduce Daisy to the \"new\" Gatsby.\\nThe whole purpose of the \"invitation\" to Nick to attend a Gatsby party was to develop a relationship with him so that Gatsby could later ask Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy.\\nNick invites Daisy to have tea at his house without telling her that Gatsby will also be there.\\nAfter an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection.\\nThey begin an affair and, after a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife\\'s relationship with Gatsby.\\nAt a luncheon at the Buchanans\\' house, Daisy speaks to Gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that Tom realizes she is in love with Gatsby.\\nThough Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is outraged by his wife\\'s infidelity.\\nHe forces the group to drive into New York City and confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel, asserting that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand.\\nIn addition to that, he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities.\\nDaisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.\\nWhen Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes on their way home, they discover that Gatsby\\'s car has struck and killed Tom\\'s mistress, Myrtle.\\nNick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car at the time of the accident but Gatsby intends to take the blame anyway.\\nMyrtle\\'s husband, George, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he recently began suspecting she has, and sets out on foot to find him.\\nAfter finding out the yellow car is Gatsby\\'s, he arrives at Gatsby\\'s mansion where he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself.\\nNick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby in which none of Gatsby\\'s associates or partygoers attend.\\nLater, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that Gatsby was Myrtle\\'s secret lover and that Gatsby had killed her, then gave George Gatsby\\'s address.\\nNick breaks up with Jordan, and, disillusioned with the East, moves back to the Midwest.\\n',\n",

three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England.\\nPicaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the Fenestrelle Fort, where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric.\\nWhen the man died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son.\\nPicaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune.\\nHe stabbed the first with a dagger on which were printed the words \"Number One\", and then he poisoned the second.\\nThe third man\\'s son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself.\\nThis third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud\\'s fiancÃ©e while Picaud was under arrest.\\nIn another of the \"True Stories\", Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family.\\nThis story, also quoted in the Pleiade edition, has obviously served as model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family.\\nThe introduction to the Pleiade edition mentions other sources from real life: AbbÃ© Faria existed and died in 1819 after a life with much resemblance to that of the Faria in the novel.\\nAs for DantÃ¨s, his fate is quite different from his model in Peuchet\\'s book, since the latter is murdered by the \"Caderousse\" of the plot.\\nBut DantÃ¨s has \"alter egos\" in two other Dumas works; in \"Pauline\" from 1838, and more significantly in \"Georges\" from 1843, where a young man with black ancestry is preparing a revenge against white people who had humiliated him.\\nOn the day of his wedding to MercÃ©dÃ¨s, Edmond

wetness of the areas to a solid form, soldiers could easily maneuver across without becoming entrapped or slowed.\\nJohn and the Hoenikker children eventually end up on the fictional Caribbean island of San Lorenzo, one of the poorest countries on Earth, where the people speak a barely comprehensible creole of English (for example \"twinkle, twinkle, little star\" is rendered \"Tsvent-kiul, tsvent-kiul, lett-pool store\").\\nIt is ruled by the dictator, \"Papa\" Monzano, who threatens all opposition with impalement on a giant hook.\\nSan Lorenzo has an unusual culture and history, which John learns about while studying a guidebook lent to him by the newly appointed US ambassador to the country.\\nHe learns about an influential religious movement in San Lorenzo, called Bokononism, a strange, postmodern faith that combines irreverent, nihilistic, and cynical observations about life and God\\'s will with odd, but peaceful rituals (for instance, the supreme act of worship is an intimate act consisting of prolonged physical contact between the bare soles of the feet of two persons, supposed to result in peace and joy between the two communicants).\\nThough everyone on the island seems to know much about Bokononism and its founder, Bokonon, the present government calls itself Christian and practicing Bokononism is punishable by death on \"the hook\".\\nAs the story progresses, it becomes clear that San Lorenzo society is more bizarre and cryptic than originally revealed.\\nIn observing the interconnected lives of some of the island\\'s most influential residents, John learns that Bokonon himself was at one point a de facto ruler of the island, along with a US Marine deserter.\\nThe two men created Bokononism as part of a utopian project to control the population.\\nThe ban was an attempt to give the religion a sense of forbidden glamour, and it is found that almost all of the residents of San Lorenzo, including the dictator, practice the faith, and executions are rare.\\nWhen John and the other travelers arrive on the island, they are greeted by President \"Papa\" Monzano, his adopted daughter Mona, and around five-thousand San Lorenzans.\\nIt becomes clear that \"Papa\" Monzano is extremely ill, and he intends to name Franklin Hoenikker his successor.\\nFranklin, who finds it hard to talk with people, is uncomfortable with this arrangement, abruptly hands the presidency to John, who grudgingly accepts.\\nFranklin also suggests that John should marry Mona.\\nThe dictator later uses ice-nine to commit suicide rather than succumb to his inoperable cancer.\\nConsistent with the properties of ice-nine, the dictator\\'s corpse instantly turns into solid ice at room temperature.\\nThis is followed by the freezing of Dr Schlichter von Koenigswald, \"Papa\" Monzano\\'s doctor and a formerS.\\nAuschwitz physician, who accidentally ingests the ice-nine upon Monzano\\'s examination.\\nJohn and the Hoenikkers plan to gather the bodies of both Monzano and his physician in order to ritualistically burn them on a funeral pyre, thereby eliminating the traces of ice-nine.\\nThey also systematically cleanse the room with various heating methods, taking the utmost care.\\nIt is here where John inquires as to how the ice-nine came into Papa Monzano\\'s possession.\\nThe Hoenikkers explain that when they were young, their father would riddle them with the concept of ice-nine.\\nOne day, they find their father has died taking a break from freezing and unfreezing ice-nine to test its properties.\\nWith the sweep of a cloth, Frank Hoenikker collects residual amounts of ice-nine from a cooking pan, as was the various collection and examination methods of their father when creating the substance.\\nA dog licks the cloth and also instantly freezes.\\nWitnessing this, the young Hoenikkers finally deduce the properties of ice-nine.\\nThey collectively cannot determine who had what part in gathering the ice-nine, but chunks of the substance were chipped from the cooking pan supply and placed in mason jars then later in thermoses.\\nThe Hoenikkers explain that this is how they had become fortunate throughout their lives, each one selling off the substance to various buyers.\\nDuring John\\'s inauguration festivities, in which the American ambassador to San Lorenzo was going to speak, San Lorenzo\\'s small air force was supposed to present a brief air show.\\nOne of the airplanes crashes into the dictator\\'s seaside palace and causes his still-frozen body to tumble into the ocean, and all the water in the world\\'s seas, rivers, and groundwater turns into ice-nine, killing almost all life in a few days.\\nJohn manages to escape with Mona to a secret bunker.\\nThey later discover a mass grave where all the surviving San Lorenzans had killed themselves with ice-nine, on the facetious advice of Bokonon.\\nDisplaying a mix of grief and resigned amusement, Mona kills herself as well.\\nJohn takes refuge with a few other survivors (an American couple he had met on the plane to San Lorenzo and Felix Hoenikker\\'s two sons), and lives in a cave for several months, during which time he writes a memoir revealed to be the novel itself.\\nThe book ends by his meeting a weary Bokonon, who is contemplating what the last words of The Books of Bokonon should be.\\nBokonon states that if he were younger, he would have climbed to the top of Mt.\\nMcCabe, placed a book about human stupidity at the peak, and, through the administration of ice-nine, \"make a statue of myself, lying on my back, grinning horribly, and thumbing my nose at You Know Who\".\\n',\n",

              " 'The text of The Plague is divided into five parts.\\nIn the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially unnoticed by the populace, begin to die in the streets.\\nHysteria develops soon afterward, causing the local newspapers to report the incident.\\nAuthorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague.\\nThe main character, dr Bernard Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building\\'s concierge, Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever.\\ndr Rieux consults his colleague, dr Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town.\\nThey both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death.\\nHowever, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic.\\nMeanwhile, Rieux\\'s wife has been sent to a sanatorium in another city, to be treated for an unrelated chronic illness.\\nAuthorities, including the Prefect, are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take.\\nOfficial notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation.\\nA \"special ward\" is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days.\\nAs the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken.\\nHomes are quarantined; corpses and burials are strictly supervised.\\nA supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is enough to treat only existing cases, and the country\\'s emergency reserves are depleted.\\nWhen the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed, and an outbreak of plague is officially declared.\\nThe town is sealed off.\\nThe town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended.\\nThe use of telephone lines is restricted only to \"urgent\" calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town.\\nThe separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters.\\nOne character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his wife in Paris after city officials refused his request to leave.\\nHe befriends some underground criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city.\\nAnother character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God punishing the citizens\\' sinful nature.\\nHis diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances.\\nCottard, a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide but fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler.\\nMeanwhile, dr Rieux; a vacationer, Jean Tarrou; and a civil servant, Joseph Grand, exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital.\\nRambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that there are others in the city, including dr Rieux, who have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind.\\nHe then decides to join Tarrou and dr Rieux to help fight the epidemic.\\nIn mid-August, the situation continues to worsen.\\nPeople try to escape the town, but some are shot by armed sentries.\\nViolence and looting break out on a small scale, and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew.\\nFunerals are conducted with more and more speed, no ceremony, and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased.\\nThe inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation.\\nDespondent, they waste away emotionally as well as physically.\\nIn September and October, the town remains at the mercy of the plague.\\nRieux hears from the sanatorium that his wife\\'s condition is worsening.\\nHe also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work.\\nCottard, on the other hand, seems to flourish during the plague because it gives him a sense of being connected to others, since everybody faces the same danger.\\nCottard and Tarrou attend a performance of Gluck\\'s opera Orpheus and Eurydice, but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance.\\nAfter extended negotiations with guards, Rambert finally has a chance to escape, but he decides to stay, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left.\\nTowards the end of October, Castel\\'s new antiplague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of Othon\\'s young son, who suffers greatly, as Paneloux, Rieux, and Tarrou tend to his bedside in horror.\\nPaneloux, who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague, gives a second sermon.\\nHe addresses the problem of an innocent child\\'s suffering and says it is a test of a Christian\\'s faith since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything.\\nHe urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague.\\nA few days after the sermon, Paneloux is taken ill.\\nHis symptoms do not conform to those of the plague, but the disease still proves fatal.\\nTarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps, where they meet Othon.\\nWhen Othon\\'s period of quarantine ends, he chooses to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son.\\nTarrou tells Rieux the story of his life and, to take their mind off the epidemic, the two men go swimming together in the sea.\\nGrand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers.\\nHowever, Grand makes an unexpected recovery, and deaths from the plague start to decline.\\nBy late January the plague is in full retreat, and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates.\\nOthon, however, does not escape death from the disease.\\nCottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic from which he has profited by shady dealings.\\nTwo government employees approach him, and he flees.\\nDespite the epidemic\\'s ending, Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after a heroic struggle.\\nRieux is later informed via telegram that his wife has also died.\\nIn February, the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities.\\nRambert is reunited with his wife.\\nCottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home.\\nHe is arrested.\\nGrand begins working on his novel again.\\nThe narrator of the chronicle reveals his identity and states and that he tried to present an objective view of the events.\\nThe narrator reflects on the epidemic and reaches the conclusion that there is more to admire than to despise in humans.\\n')"
